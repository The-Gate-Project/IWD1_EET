@139   = ~This is rather embarrassing... but, I'm having somewhat of a pest problem down in that dirty ol' cellar and I'm afraid to go down there.  I do so hate bugs!  Just the thought of those nasty creepies and crawlies sends shivers down my spine.~
@140   = ~That's awfully sweet of you, dearie.  But, I don't expect you to go to any trouble on my account.  I'm sure I'll think of something.~
@141   = ~Wonderful!  The stairs to the cellar are in the back room.  Now you be careful down there, dearie, and don't let any of those little buggers creep back up here, alright?~
@142   = ~Hmm.  I suppose I could scrape together a couple of coins as payment for such a service.  Let see... how about five gold?  Would that do, dearie?~
@143   = ~Sorry, dearie.  I haven't the time to chitchat with you.  I've a tavern to run, you know.  If you are looking to catch up on the local gossip, I suggest you buy a round or mingle with some of the other patrons. ~
@144   = ~Hmph!  Look, stranger... up here in Easthaven, we may be out on the frontier, but we do manage to act civilized toward one another.  If you can't at least try to be polite, then there's the door, dearie.~
@145   = ~Well now!  Aren't we the greedy one?  The way I see it, five coins is better than no coins.  Take it or leave it, dearie.~
@146   = ~Any luck getting rid of those nasty bugs, dearie?  My customers are getting pretty thirsty.~
@147   = ~How about a drink?~
@148   = ~I have some questions for you.~
@149   = ~Nothing, thank you.  Just passing through.~
@150   = ~How about a drink?~

@156   = ~My, aren't you the sharp one?  How about that drink?~
@157   = ~You've run out of everything?~
@158   = ~What kind of tavern are you running here?~
@159   = ~No spirits?  That's it, I'm gone.~
@160   = ~But what?~
@161   = ~Well I suggest you march on down there and get me something to drink, woman.~
@162   = ~Yes. I think I should be leaving. Farewell.~
@163   = ~I see.  Is there anything I can do to help?~
@164   = ~A big girl like you afraid of bugs?  Come on, show a little backbone.~
@165   = ~Great, a tavern with no booze and bugs to boot.  I can't wait to see the rest of this town.~
@166   = ~I'll just come back when you've solved your little problem.  Farewell.~
@167   = ~Have no fear, madam.  I shall see to it that the pests down below trouble you no further.~
@168   = ~I could see to your pest problem... for a price, of course.~
@169   = ~Well, best of luck to you.  Farewell.~
@170   = ~Five is plenty.  Your pests are as good as gone.~
@171   = ~It'll do, though it's hardly a fair sum for such a service.~
@172   = ~Five gold!  What will I ever do with such a treasure?  Stop wasting my time.~
@173   = ~Thank you, dearie.  You're a lifesaver.  Just do me one more favor... keep this little bug problem between you and me.  I don't want folks thinking Grisella's place isn't clean.  Run along now.~
@174   = ~On second thought, forget it.  I'll drink somewhere else.~
@175   = ~Alright, how about a drink?~
@176   = ~Alright, how about a drink?~
@177   = ~Very well, I'll leave you to your work.  Farewell.~
@178   = ~My apologies.  Is there anything I can do to help with your problem?~
@179   = ~Right.  I'm off then.  Farewell.~
@180   = ~Alright, alright.  I'll take the job for five gold.~
@181   = ~Right.  I'm off then.  Farewell.~
@182   = ~Not just yet.  I'm working on it, though.~
@183   = ~In due time -- and stop calling me dearie!  It's just plain silly!~
@184   = ~It is done.  Those bugs won't be troubling you anymore.~
@185   = ~Thank you.  Before I go, I would like to purchase some spells.~
@186   = ~Hello.  My name is Accalia.  I'm an initiate here at the temple of Tempus.  I help Everard maintain the temple armory and perform rituals.~
@187   = ~Tempus is revered a great deal by the barbarian tribes up here.  They call him "Tempos."  We immigrants see a lot of conflict and violence in these parts, and people want to make sense out of it all.~
@188   = ~We celebrate the Feast of the Moon in remembrance of the battle dead.  We also sing the Song of the Sword at least once a tenday.  Because of the church's close proximity to the site of so many great battles, our congregation also has local celebrations to remember all of the mighty conflicts that have raged across Icewind Dale.  The most important daily ceremonies are the Feast of Heroes at highsun and the Song for the Fallen at sunset.~
@189   = ~It changes from season to season, from year to year... like all things.  They are mistrustful of us immigrants and often view our settlements here as an intrusion on their land.  Sometimes they trade with us, sometimes they war with us.~
@190   = ~It is actually part of a simple truth that we Tempurans believe.  Conflict is all around us.  Every man and woman has something that he or she believes in, which he or she will die to promote or preserve.  Tempus tells us that we should live for something of importance.  If we kill, if we die... the same.  We preach that conflict and war are vital to mankind's existence.~
@191   = ~The point is that it's not "gloomy."  It's not an end unto itself.  Conflict, war - they are the means to an end.  Tempus does not determine the merit of a cause.  He simply measures the valor and dedication of those who are brave enough to fight, kill and die for what they believe in.~
@192   = ~I am originally from Neverwinter.  I came here to aid Battlelord Everard when the former Warpriest, Renfeld, was killed in a battle against the barbarians near Bryn Shander.~
@193   = ~True, the church of Myrkul does perform ceremonies for the dead, but that foul god does them no honor.  Tempus holds a special place in his heart for those who have died in battle, showing valor and passion.  We celebrate their deaths to show respect for a life given to battle.~
@194   = ~We celebrate the Battle of Jerrod's Stone.  I'd tell you more about it, but Everard prefers that any questions about it be directed to him... he has somewhat of a different perspective on the teachings than most.  Ask him about it if you see him.~
@195   = ~They're pretty straightforward.  The Feast of Heroes is a meal that we eat at highsun.  During it, we remember the final meal which each warrior eats before he or she enters mortal battle.  The Song for the Fallen is a dirge that we sing at sunset as a daily memorial for those who have died in battle.~
@196   = ~It is just part of our daily routine.  We know that the barbarians are just a few peaks away and we immigrants understand the danger that they bring into our lives.~
@197   = ~That is exceptionally rude.  We are different from the barbarians, but they are honorable people who brave extremely harsh conditions and live proud lives.  I do not believe we have anything more to discuss.  Good day.~
@198   = ~This temple is a symbol of the endurance of mankind in the face of adversity.  I will not have you insult my people or my faith again.  Try it and I'll crack your blasphemous head against the corner of the nearest building.  Believe me, people here wouldn't criticize me for doing it if I told them what you just said.  Good day.~
@199   = ~Exactly.  That is why we Easthaveners practice the Tempuran faith and perform the rituals of the Lord of Battles.~
@200   = ~Thank you for starting an argument with me.  You have proven my point admirably.  Good day... idiot.~
@201   = ~We all must seek our own paths through life.  I have chosen the path of the warrior, walking in the bloody footsteps of the Lord of Battles.  As a woman, it is difficult to do at times, especially since I am a foreigner to this land.  The native barbarians do not believe that foreigners understand what "Tempos" really stands for, and they certainly don't believe that women can be his champions or representatives on Toril.  Perhaps someday this will change.~
@202   = ~Everard... well, Everard is still adjusting to his position here.  I think he'd much rather still be serving Tempus on the front lines, but his duty is to guard this holy site - the site of Jerrod's Stone.  You should ask him about it; he knows more of the tale than I do. ~
@203   = ~Hello again.  Can I help you with something?~
@204   = ~Well, well.  It's you again.  Why are you bothering me?  I have nothing to say to you.~
@205   = ~Well met, Accalia.  I'm <CHARNAME>.  You're an initiate in the Tempuran faith, eh?  I didn't realize that the Lord of Battles was so popular up here.~
@206   = ~Greetings, Accalia.  Rituals, you say?  What kind of rituals?~
@207   = ~Well met, Accalia, but I have to go.  Farewell.~
@208   = ~Barbarian tribes?  How do they feel about the Ten-Towns being here?~
@209   = ~And what sense *can* be made out of it all?~
@210   = ~I suppose you could make sense out it, but why not seek a spiritual anchor for hope instead of a gloomy explanation about mankind's warlike nature?~
@211   = ~You said, "We immigrants."  Where are you from?~
@212   = ~This is a harsh realm, indeed.  I must take my leave now.  Farewell, Accalia.~

@224   = ~What are the "Feast of Heroes" and the "Song for the Fallen?"~
@225   = ~That's interesting.  It was nice speaking with you, Accalia, but I must be off.  Farewell.~
@226   = ~Sounds like a love-hate relationship.  At least they don't try to kill you *all* the time.~
@227   = ~What's this?  New face in town, eh?  Well met, stranger.  The name is Hrothgar, originally of Hillsfar, but now, after years of traveling up, down, and under Faerun, I am content to call this town my home.  Who might you be?~ [HROT_01]
@228   = ~Bah!  Some civilized nation should come up here and smash the life out of those impudent barbarians.  How do they expect progress to be made?  By sitting on the tundra and beating on a stupid drum?~
@229   = ~Well then, welcome to Easthaven, <CHARNAME>.  Whatever your business in these parts might be, I would offer you this small piece of advice: while you're in my town you'd do well to be on your best behavior.  These folk are under my protection, and anyone who would seek to do harm to them in any way shall answer to me.~
@230   = ~I suppose it is their nature to see the immigrants as a threat to their way of life.  The tribes' anger is probably more out of cultural isolation than any actual threat.~
@231   = ~Well met, friend.  And welcome to my home.  Make yourselves comfortable, but try not to break anything.  Many of these curiosities that you see lying about have... sentimental value.~ [HROT_04]
@232   = ~Ah, they're all remembrances of my adventuring days, little trinkets and the like that I picked up here and there.  More keepsakes than valuables really, leftovers from my days of fortune and glory.  ~ [HROT_05]
@233   = ~I suppose it is their nature to see the immigrants as a threat to their way of life.  The tribes' anger is probably more out of cultural isolation than any actual threat.~
@234   = ~Semi retired, actually.  This region is still untamed and fraught with many dangers.  I've had plenty of opportunities in the last few years to take up my sword and shield and do battle with those who threaten the safety of Easthaven and its neighbors.  In fact, I'm planning such an expedition right now.  That is what I wanted to speak to you about.~
@235   = ~Oh I've seen my share of fortune as well, rest assured.  I've beheld more treasure than most kings, I'd wager.  But it wasn't for coins that I fought and bled all those years.  It was for something grander, more powerful than mere riches.  Adventuring is something that is in your blood, not in your purse.~
@236   = ~And well they should.  You people treat this land like garbage!  Why, this very temple is an affront to the pristine beauty of the Spine of the World.~
@237   = ~You said "us immigrants."  Where are you from?~
@238   = ~Brother Gus~
@239   = ~Indeed?  Well then, this might interest you.  I'm putting together an expedition of sorts, one which would surely provide opportunities for both fortune *and* glory.  This is the business I wished to speak to you about.~ [HROT_10]
@240   = ~We've received word from Kuldahar, our neighbors to the south, that evil forces are stirring nearby in the Spine of the World Mountains.  I am organizing and leading a party from Easthaven south to Kuldahar Valley to investigate.  You look to be capable enough, perhaps you would like to join us.  What say you?~
@241   = ~Don't really know.  The messenger wasn't too specific.  I suppose if you want more details you could ask old Everard over at the temple, but time's a-wasting.  We need to get this expedition moving before the snows seal off the pass to Kuldahar.  What's it going to be?  You in or out?~
@242   = ~This seems to be a dangerous place to live.  I must be going now.  Farewell.~
@243   = ~Hold a moment - just, just hear me out.  Now I've already managed to rally together a few swords for this expedition, but I fear our numbers may not be great enough for the task at hand.  I figure that you might tip the balance in our favor.~ [HROT_15]
@244   = ~Well, as you wish.  Can't say I'm not disappointed, though.  I took you for the adventuring type.  Oh well, I suppose you'll make great fishermen, seeing as how that's the only *safe* occupation around these parts.~ [HROT_16]
@245   = ~I agree.  Even if we don't like the fact that it's happening, conflict is pretty inevitable in life.~
@246   = ~Excellent!  Glad to have you onboard.  I plan to assemble the rest of the expedition and set out for Kuldahar within a few days.  With storms brewing in the mountains, I'd rather we depart sooner, but there are matters that require my attention here about town. ~
@247   = ~What a joke.  I can't believe you're actually serious.  War isn't vital to our existence.  How about things like love and tolerance?  How do those fit into Tempus' plan?  Some theory you got there.~
@248   = ~Back again I see.  Have you reconsidered my offer to join the expedition?~ [HROT_19]
@249   = ~Ho there, friend.  Everything is nearly in order.  We shall be departing for Kuldahar soon.  I suggest you get that supply list over to Pomab before he starts whining.  Testy little fellow, that one.~ [HROT_20]
@250   = ~That's something to think about.  I must be going now.  Farewell.~
@251   = ~There you are!  All is set.  The others are assembling as we speak.  Are you ready to leave as well?~ [HROT_21]
@252   = ~Make haste!  I spotted heavy clouds hanging over the mountains this morning.  I suspect snow will fall in the passes earlier than normal this season.~ [HROT_22]
@253   = ~Hmm.  That seems like a rather empty philosophy.  I'd much rather belong to a religion that stands for something of moral significance.~
@254   = ~You do have a point.  I suppose I do practice what you preach.  The battle between good and evil is as old as Abeir-Toril itself.  However, I cannot revere conflict itself.  Even if I rely on war to accomplish my goals, I certainly do not cherish the activity.~
@255   = ~A spirited one, eh?  I like that.  Well, whatever your business in these parts might be, I would offer you this small piece of advice: while you're in my town you'd do well to be on your best behavior.  These folk are under my protection, and anyone who would seek to do harm to them in any way shall answer to me.~
@256   = ~That said, I'll let you get back to your cups.  I'm sure you've had a long journey, and you'll find there's no better way to shake off the cold of the road than by downing a few mugs of Grisella's best.  If you're in need of lodging, I would recommend talking to Quimby over at the Snowdrift Inn over on the east side of town.  Once you've had a chance to rest up and get your bearings, come by and see me at my house.  It's just a couple doors west of here.  There's some business I would discuss with you.  Farewell.~
@257   = ~Please.  Stay here and relax a while.  I wish I could join you, but there are things that require my attention presently.  Come by my house later and we shall talk.  Farewell.~ [HROT_28]
@258   = ~Ouch.  I guess those barbarians really don't like the immigrants too much.~
@259   = ~What's Everard like?~
@260   = ~Actually, now that I think about it, maybe you can help.  Pomab, the local shopkeeper, has recently expressed concern over the rapidly thinning stock of his store.  He's been complaining that the regular caravan from Caer-Dinival is long overdue, and that if they don't arrive soon, he's sure to be out of business.  Normally, I take Pomab's whining with a grain of salt, but with heavy snows on the way, it'd be best to make sure that caravan makes it through.~
@261   = ~You may not enter the store at this time.~
@262   = ~Interesting.  Farewell.~
@263   = ~I see.  What local battles do you celebrate?~
@264   = ~How pathetic.  Holding a celebration for those who have thrown away their lives...that's just stupid.~
@265   = ~Thanks for the information.  Farewell.~

@275   = ~I want you to find that caravan.  Leave town by way of the south bridge and scout the hills west of Lac Dinneshere--between Easthaven and Caer-Dinival.  Caravans always stick close to the shoreline this time of year.  Once you find it, see the caravan safely to Easthaven.  In the mean time, I'll assemble the rest of the expedition and make the final plans for our journey.  Return here as quickly as you can, we must make for Kuldahar Pass while the weather is favorable.  Good luck and safe journey.~
@276   = ~Thank you.  I must take my leave now.  Farewell.~
@277   = ~This is grave news indeed.  My only hope is that the town has enough supplies to last us through the winter.  In any case, at least we now know for certain what happened to the caravan.  Now I can concentrate getting everything in order for our expedition to Kuldahar.~ [HROT_35]
@278   = ~You said, "We immigrants."  Where are you from?~
@279   = ~Strange, it is not usual for orcs to be so brazen as to attack caravans so close to town.  I wonder if it is the anticipation of the coming winter that is driving their actions, or if it is something more.  In any case, at least we can still retrieve the supplies, thanks to you.  You've proven yourself to be quite capable... I'm glad you've decided to come along with us to Kuldahar. ~
@280   = ~It seems almost pointless to live in such harsh conditions.  Aren't people afraid?~
@281   = ~We still have preparations to make before we can depart for Kuldahar.  Take this list of supplies to Pomab's Emporium across town.  While you are there you might outfit yourselves with whatever gear you think you may need.  Return here when you are packed and ready to go.~
@282   = ~Ah, good... you've returned.  What news of the caravan from Caer-Dinival?~ [HROT_40]
@283   = ~Thanks.  Farewell.~

@353   = ~A stranger clad in woodland garb staggered into town the other night and collapsed on the doorstep over at the temple.  They say he was poisoned.  His face was all purple and blue, and his tongue had swelled up so's that he eventually choked to death on it.  Not a pleasant way to go, if you ask me.~

@382   = ~Excellent, it's a deal then.  But before I go on my, uh, secret dwarven expedition, I wanted to ask you some things about Easthaven.~
@383   = ~Aye, I think that's her name - she came into town a few days ago.  Have to say, I thought she was a man at first, with that beard and all.  Can't see how you dwarves get used to it.  ~
@384   = ~Hildreth... I may go look for her after we speak, then.  I wanted to ask you about Easthaven first, though.~

@386   = ~Well met, friend.  I am Erevain Blacksheaf of Evereska.  It has been many moons since I have seen friendly faces.  Despite the dreary nature of our current locale, Easthaven is a welcome sight for these elven eyes.~
@387   = ~When I set out from Evereska, I was used to a peaceful life.  I had no idea what wonders and horrors the life of adventure would bring to my ever-changing doorstep.  I'm glad I didn't go on the Retreat twenty years ago.~

@389   = ~Ah, I suppose it's fine.  I'm just used to the sunny climate of my homeland.  This place is like an icy anvil where the hammer of Auril smashes down upon us, leaving the landscape barren and the horizon foreboding in every direction.~
@390   = ~Answer me, Corellon... why do I always have to get the idiots?~
@391   = ~Uh... no.  I can't say that I have.  I think I have to be going now.  It was... nice talking to you, friend.  Sweet water and light laughter... I guess.~
@392   = ~The Retreat is the gradual migration of Tel'Quessir to the isle of Evermeet.  It should only take a few hundred years for all of the People to complete the migration.  Until then, I've decided to explore the rest of Faerun.~

@394   = ~Grrrr.  GRRRRR.  NO! NO! NO!  NOOOOOO!  Why does everyone keep asking me that?!~
@395   = ~Well, I haven't heard any rumors lately.  However, when I traveled through Kuldahar, I had a strange feeling about something in that valley.  It's more than just the weather that bothered me.  Something seemed amiss in the mountains, the trees, even the clouds in the sky.  Something was out of place.  Something was... wrong.~
@396   = ~Well met, again, friends.~
@397   = ~Oh.  You again.  Leave me alone, please.  I'm not interested in talking to you.~
@398   = ~Yes.  I've heard the locals are forming an expedition into the Kuldahar Pass to investigate some problems there.  I won't be going with them, though I may pass through the area.~

@405   = ~Hmph!  That's why it's called "adventure," stupid elf-person.~

@413   = ~Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The Retreat.  I gotcha.  So... hear any good rumors lately?~
@414   = ~Being a traveler, you must hear a lot of interesting things.  Have you heard anything interesting lately?~
@415   = ~The ranger Kivan has told us that the leader of the bandits is named Tazok.~
@416   = ~We killed Lysan, the Auril priestess, and returned to Kresselack. Unfortunately, all Kresselack could tell us was that neither he or nor anyone in the Vale of Shadows was responsible for the evil plaguing Kuldahar. It seems we will need to go back to Arundel and inform him of this. Perhaps he will have a clue as to what we should do next. ~
@417   = ~Ooooh!  Ooooh!  An elf!  Are you a Bladesinger?  Can you wield two weapons at the same time?  Can you dodge Fireballs and sleep upside-down in trees?  Ooooh!  Ooooh!  Tell me you can!~
@418   = ~So you came to Icewind Dale?  Elf, you're stupid.  This place is stupid too.~
@419   = ~Good luck with your travels.  It was nice talking to you, but I have to go.  Farewell.~
@420   = ~Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's not fun.  I gotcha.  So... hear any good rumors lately?~
@421   = ~True, true.  Being a traveler, you must hear a lot of interesting things.  Have you heard anything interesting lately?~
@422   = ~Yeah, I suppose your right.  I have to be getting back to the "icy anvil" myself.  Farewell.~
@423   = ~Who you calling id-jut?!  I are saying fare-well.~
@424   = ~Yeah?  I'm an idiot?  Well... you're a little pointy-eared tree-hugger!  Elfy!  Ha!  Yeah!  How do you like THAT, Mister Elfy Elf-Face?  Farewell... elfy.~
@425   = ~Oh, so I'm an idiot, am I?  Why don't you step a little closer and say that?  Let's see what you're made of, pansy.~

@428   = ~Interesting.  Hear any good rumors on your way here?~

@430   = ~I wish you well on your travels.  Farewell.~
@431   = ~Hmm.  Thanks for the advice.  Have any other information to share?~
@432   = ~Yeah, whatever.  Anyone tries to pull one over on me and I'll take 'em out so quickly I'll be a LEGEND in these parts.  Move over heroes, there's a new shire-reeve in town.  I'm so fast I can practically dance on the tip of a sword.  WHOOSH!  WHOOSH!  Watch me go!~
@433   = ~I'll keep that in mind.  Farewell.~

@435   = ~Pray to your fruity gods, elfboy.  It's time for your head to "Retreat" from your body.~
@436   = ~Now that you mention it, something does seem out of place.  I can't quite put my finger on it, but... yes.  Something's been odd about the weather.  Be careful in your travels.  Farewell.~
@437   = ~Sorry we upset you Mr. Garbage Can.  We just want to ask you, is that your natural stench we smell or did you make a mess in your armor because our weapons scared you.~
@438   = ~Too bad, good bye.~
@439   = ~We apologize for our hasty words, can we start over again?~
@440   = ~Eh?  I haven't noticed anything.  Thanks for talking, though.  Farewell.~

@451   = ~A wolf somehow got into my workshop and is tearing the place apart.  It attacked me as I was opening the shop this morning.  I was so startled by the sight of the beast that I accidentally broke the key off in the lock while trying to get away.  Now I can't even get back in.~
@452   = ~I am a scrimshander.  I carve the huge, bony skulls of knucklehead trout into fine works of art.  This summer, southlanders will come up and buy my pieces to take back to their fancy shops -- that is, of course, if I ever get any work done.  Damn wolf!~
@453   = ~I'd be most grateful if you could go in there and get rid of that stupid thing for me.  Then I could get back to my scrimshaw.  Of course, you'll have to find a way to get the door open first.~

@464   = ~I don't care!  Break it down if you have to.  I doubt it'll come to that, though.  Judging by the looks of you, I'd say you've picked more than your share of locks.  My door shouldn't be much of a challenge. ~

@1293  = ~Hmm.  Okay.  Thanks, Albion.  Farewell.~
@1294  = ~Ah.  Arundel, Arundel.  Why did that tree-loving fool have to get involved with this?  He will hang by his entrails on his precious tree once we are finished with him.

@1318  = ~Have you ever been afraid of snakes, little one?  Have you ever trembled at the sound of his hiss?  You are afraid because you recognize a master race.  Long before your kind danced on these lands, my people ruled on high!  It shall be that way again, humanoid!  All shall bask in the glory of Sseth!  None shall stand against Yxunomei, his princess!  Ah ha ha ha ha!~
@1319  = ~I still have no idea what you're talking about.~

@1336  = ~Please don't devour me.  Just let me leave.~
@1337  = ~My friend, even if I were in possession of that item, I would not give it to you.  It is a tool of our leader, Yxunomei.  Revel in the glory of your death!  The ritual of your kind's destruction marks the setting of your sun and the rising of Sseth's black star.~

Unfortunately, all Kresselack could tell me was that neither he nor anyone in the Vale of Shadows was responsible for the evil plaguing Kuldahar. It seems we will need to go back to Arundel and inform him of this. Perhaps he will have a clue as to what we should do next. ~
@1341  = ~Look... I don't care about your plans.  Just let me continue on my way.~
@1342  = ~Oh no, my friend!  Not until you have felt the warm, tight embrace of our lord Sseth!  Come closer... closer...~

@1348  = ~I don't think so.  Your cowardice sickens me.  Your pathetic gods granted you the blessing of a backbone.  It is clear to me now that you unholy wretches have degenerated to the point where you don't even have that.  No scales, no tail, no backbone, no purpose... truly a wretched form of "life."  I will put you out of your misery.~

@1745  = ~I suspect that was a story she told you so you wouldn't know she was going on religious retreats. She was a priestess of Auril, and she would head up into the Vale to do the will of her goddess. She... won't be coming back.~
@1746  = ~That was merely a convenient lie she told you so you wouldn't suspect her motives. Obviously, it worked. She was a priestess of that frost-bitch, Auril, and I had to kill her before she did any more of her goddess' work.~

@1750  = ~I... see. Well, to tell the truth, I suspected Lysan was something more than she let on... but still... an Auril priestess? My. Well, I'll see that her belongings are thrown out and burned without del--~
@1751  = ~Wait -- her belongings? Do you mind if I keep them? There might be some, uh, clues in them. Especially if they're valuable.~
@1752  = ~I would like to see these items. Perhaps they contain some clues as to what is transpiring in the Dale. If not, then I shall see that they are kept safe. ~
@1753  = ~Uh... no, no, I worship Tempus. I have no love of the cold, I assure you. Ask the brothers and Calliana - I am a devout man. ~
@1754  = ~Very well, then it seems *one* of Kuldahar's problems has been solved, but I suspect Lysan was only a part of a much larger threat. ~

@1779  = ~Well, you're in and out of luck. We don't have any rooms, but that pug-nosed knee-high at the Evening Shade, Aldwin, has some rooms for let, if you're interested. Better hope you have enough coin, though... I doubt a pile of gold would be enough for that copper-clenching mole. ~
@1780  = ~I... take it you don't like halflings.~
@1781  = ~I don't care much for your tone... or your choice of words. Do you have some sort of problem with halflings?~
@1782  = ~Hardly a recommendation. I take it you don't care for this halfling much.~
@1783  = ~Oh, Aldwin and I came to an... arrangement. I think gold is the least of his worries.~
@1784  = ~It's nothing to do with him being half a man - if so, then most of Kuldahar would be guilty. It's his manner; that ill-mannered excuse for a gunny sack came into ownership of that inn recently, and it's a queer thing *how* he did, too. ~
@1785  = ~How so?~
@1786  = ~~
@1787  = ~~
@1788  = ~~
@1789  = ~Aldwin and I have discussed this - the truth of the matter is that he came across the previous innkeeper dead in the inn, and then forged the claim. He has admitted his crime, and since Eidan has no relatives, I see no reason to punish Aldwin further. ~
@1790  = ~Well, the previous innkeeper, Eidan, is one of the folks who've gone missing of late - thing is, he's one of the only ones that seems to *know* he was going missing, 'cause he left a claim on who to pass the inn onto in case he needed to be put to sleep with a shovel.~
@1791  = ~Go on...~
@1792  = ~Then, barely a day after he's gone, Aldwin shows up like a winter wolf out of the fresh-fallen snow, with the claim in his paws and sets up shop, pretty as you please. ~
@1793  = ~Well, Eidan could have just been looking ahead. People leave legacies and wills all the time. ~
@1794  = ~Hmmmm. Sounds like he's pulling a swindle... er, not that I would know anything about swindles. Maybe I should poke around the Evening Shade a little, see what I can find. Can you tell me anything else?~
@1795  = ~Sounds like one man's misfortune is another's good fortune. What else do you know about it?~
@1796  = ~Well, I knew Eidan, and the fool was a right enough fellow, but he had the palsy so bad he couldn't even write his own name, much less a claim - and that's even if he *was* in the know about his letters, which he *wasn't.* ~
@1797  = ~I see. Interesting. Maybe I'll ask Aldwin about the claim he has. In the meantime, where would I find a meal around here?~
@1798  = ~That is strange. By the way, I'm part of an expedition - from Easthaven, looking for troubles in Kuldahar. I was wondering if you could help me.~
@1799  = ~Thanks, Amelia. You've been very helpful. ~
@1800  = ~Hmmmph. Well, we'll see. I don't trust him, I don't. He could have killed Eidan himself, he could've. That little runt better watch himself around here, or I'll use him as a welcome mat. ~
@1801  = ~I'm hungry, and a meal would suit me, if the kitchen's still open.~
@1802  = ~I'm part of an expedition - from Easthaven, looking for troubles in Kuldahar. I was wondering if you could help me.~
@1803  = ~Very... well, then. Farewell.~
@1804  = ~If it's a meal you're after, tell that filthy goateed wine-spider squatting behind the bar to stop drinking the stock and fire up the oven. But you'd best shout - he's too deep in his cups to hear you if you talk civilized-like.~
@1805  = ~I may do that - say, I'm part of an expedition - from Easthaven, looking for troubles in Kuldahar. I was wondering if you could help me.~
@1806  = ~I... see. Do you know where I could find a room for the night?~
@1807  = ~Very well, then. I will go speak to the barkeep.~
@1808  = ~Oh, that so? Well, we should all be blessed, then, our bone-carving neighbors trudging through the drifts to make sure we're all right. What's Easthaven worried about us for?~
@1809  = ~We heard of strange events in the region - goblins, orcs, and other humanoids seem to be gathering in Easthaven... and Kuldahar. Do you have any idea why?~
@1810  = ~No, no, I don't - I mean, we've had our share of raiders before, but this year's been worse than any other I can recall. ~
@1811  = ~~
@1812  = ~Never mind. I'm more in the mood for a meal than talking at the moment.~
@1813  = ~Do you know where I can find a room for the night?~
@1814  = ~I see. Thanks for the information. I'll let you know if I need anything more. ~
@1815  = ~Well, I've heard tell of raiders -- goblins and the like -- *never* seen in the Pass before. Folks, travelers, have gone missing, and no one knows where. Lots of strange goings-on, got a lot of folks worried. You might want to speak to Arundel - if his beard's any sign, he's got a lot of knowing to his years. You can find him at the base of the great tree - his is the two-storied house to the south and west.~
@1816  = ~I see. Is there any place I could get a meal? ~

You must feel very proud to be able to leap out of the primordial ooze of godly creation, gasp for a moment in the air, and lie on the shore in the belief that you won't die like all the other fish.  All the while, elephants of stone stomp on these celestial shores and you, in your blindness, take no note.~
@1992  = ~No.  You are one of many fireflies dancing for a moment in the night, feeling at your brightest that you can illuminate the universe at will.  I am a star.  I came into existence when your world took form.  I am as persistent as time.  Where I move, infernal tides crush foreign shores and nations of thought are drowned in blood.~

You should recognize them as prophets.~
@1997  = ~You cannot have it.  It is mine.  When I am finished with it, my faithful servants will have it.  If they fail in their plans, simply take it from them.  I have little patience when it comes to incompetence.~

The lifeblood of your world is being eaten by those who would rather spin energy into entropy than channel it.  It is only a matter of time.~

@2007  = ~The concepts of male and female, child and adult, are not only absent from my home, but completely irrelevant in warfare.  I care not about physical shells.  Souls are the meat of my existence.  They are the light that filters down to my eyes under a sea of entropy.~

@2028  = ~We spoke with Sister Calliana, the acting head priest of the Temple of Ilmater in Kuldahar. She's assumed the role of head priest of the temple ever since Mother Egenia vanished a few weeks ago.  Calliana also mentioned that another member of the Ilmater clergy, a man by the name of Brother Poquelin, passed through Kuldahar recently from all the way from Cormyr and was going to try and get help from the Monastery of the Weeping Lilac in Bryn Shader.  Calliana fears he may have been abducted as well. ~

@2052  = ~We penetrated the inner sanctum of the Temple of the Forgotten God only to find that someone had gotten their before us. The pedestal that, presumably, had once held the artifact was empty.  Bodies lay strewn about the chamber, indicating that the acolytes and their verbeeg guardians had put up fight in the defense of the gem.  Among the bodies was the corpse of man garbed in the vestments of a priest of Talona.  It is difficult to say what part he might have played in the battle or the resulting theft.  Perhaps we should return to Arundel and see what sense he can make of all this.~

Aldwin presented a claim that seemed to indicate that Eidan knew he was going away - but according to Amelia, Eidan didn't know how to write, and even if he did, he was stricken with the palsy.

If we find any old keys, books, notes, documents, or other trinkets on our quest, we might be able to come back and sell them to him, just to lighten our load. He said we can always buy the items back later if it turns out we need them.~

@2328  = ~Crafted in 1021 DR for the warrior Makael the Lean, Turodahel has a bloody military history.  Makael was a mercenary who sold his services to anyone with the right amount of coin.  Shrewd and crafty by reputation, Makael applied his skills and the power of Turodahel carefully for over three decades.  It wasn't until after Makael died of a magical disease that legends about the man started to spring up.  It is believed by modern sages that Makael is likely to have killed over five hundred men with his sword over the years.  It was widely known that Makael was neither especially strong nor tough.  People assumed that it must have been the power of the sword that did his deeds.  Makael's grave was robbed within a few years of his burial.

For the next few decades, warriors and thieves from all over the Moonsea and Dalelands schemed and murdered to get hold of Makael's legendary sword.  One priest of Bane, curious about the sword's powers, stole Makael's skull for divination.  When questioned about the magical abilities of the weapon, Makael's spirit answered from beyond the grave with one word, "turodahel."  The Banite searched through his books for months before he discovered the origins of the word in a Netherese lexicon.  Roughly translated, "turodahel" is a compound noun meaning "the power of discretion."

@2341  = ~An evil has come to these mountains.  The face of the evil remains hidden, but its presence is unmistakable.  All about us, there are signs of its damaging influence on the balance... the unnatural weather, the recent rash of abductions, the numerous monster sightings in the pass.  All point toward something sinister.  Even the animals sense something is amiss.~
@2342  = ~I can only tell you of what little I know.  Which disturbances would you have me speak of?~ [ARUN_12]
@2343  = ~The weather in these mountains has always been harsh, but never like this.  Fierce storms ravage the valley without warning, often lasting for several days at a time before vanishing as quickly as they come.  It is barely midway into Leafall, and yet the pass to the south has been snowed in entirely.  Weather such as this is most unnatural.  Nature presents itself in cycles that are predictable by those who know what to look for.~
@2344  = ~Ah yes.  Terrible.  Terrible.  At first, there were tales told by travelers of companions disappearing into the night, snatched up from their bedrolls as they camped along the narrow trail that winds through the pass.  We did not think much of these tales, for such occurrences are not unheard of in these mountains.  Then one night Conlan's boy, Sheemish, went missing.  The next morning, the whole town searched for the boy but turned up nothing.  He was just gone.  Vanished without a trace.~
@2345  = ~The boy was just the first.  Several nights later, another disappeared.  Maegan Potts, the local midwife.  Her husband Kaleel was grief-stricken to the point of madness.  With barely a word to anyone, he snatched up his sword and marched off into the darkness after his wife.  No one has heard from him since.  And now, the abductions are occurring more frequently.  Eidan, the old innkeeper from the Evening Shade was taken only three days ago.~
@2346  = ~As I'm sure you have noticed by now, there seems to be quite a few goblins about.  It is not usual to see so many of their kind roaming the mountains so late in the year.  It is almost as something has drawn them out of holes, like carrion birds drawn to the scent of death.  As if the goblins weren't enough, several giants have been spotted moving through the pass in groups as large as ten.  ~
@2347  = ~That many giants traveling together in such numbers indicates they are organized and are acting with a singular purpose.  I have watched their activities closely.  Their tracks trace a deliberate pattern through the mountains, almost as if they were on patrol.  Another thing... while I was out scouting the giants, I discovered other sets of tracks, tracks I have never encountered before.  What manner of beast made them... I could not say.~
@2348  = ~*The* balance.  It is what the druids of Kuldahar hold sacred and have worked to preserve for generations.  It is all around us.  It *is* us.  Balance is the harmony that is achieved when man and nature learn to coexist, no longer contending with one another, but coming together as two parts of a whole.~
@2349  = ~Balance is the belief that this town is built upon... the very reason for its existence.  Druids of Sylvanus, the Oakfather, have tended this shrine since the beginning.  For hundreds of years, we have striven to achieve the ideal balance between man and nature.  When settlers finally came to this pass, it was the Archdruid Tolben, my predecessor, who laid the foundation for the relationship that lead to birth of this community.~
@2350  = ~The Great Oak.  The massive tree that stands above us... around us.  It is a holy shrine to Sylvanus, for it was he who planted its seed when Faerun was first born.  It is a testament to the raw power of nature, a monument to its ability to thrive in the face of adversity.  Thanks to Tolben, the Great Oak we druids called the Kuldahar, and the town that has come to be known by the same name, have together become a monument of even greater significance... a monument to the balance.~
@2351  = ~Tolben was the catalyst for the transformation of the shrine from a sacred grove to a thriving community in which man and nature exist as one.  At first, settlers were kept away from this site.  The druids of old saw outsiders as an affront to the sanctity of the tree and its sphere of benign influence.  ~ [ARUN_30]
@2352  = ~They erected thorny brambles to keep intruders out, and used their powers to frighten away the men and women that came to build homes in a place they felt was... obviously so close to the gods.~ [ARUN_31]
@2353  = ~It wasn't until the succession of Archdruid Tolben that things changed.  Unlike his predecessors, he believed that the settlement of the valley was not only inevitable, but it was actually the will of Sylvanus.  He also believed that we had been wrong in keeping the settlers away, and that the Oak Father had intended people to share in the miracle of the Great Oak from the beginning.  ~
@2354  = ~When Tolben finally became Archdruid, he formed a plan to fulfill the destiny of this sacred site by bringing about a union between the Great Oak shrine and the settlers.  ~ [ARUN_34]
@2355  = ~It was this union that the Archdruid Tolben believed would achieve the harmony that we had been striving for generations... the harmony between man and nature.  As it stands, Kuldahar is a monument to this vision.  The tree and town exist in a natural symbiosis where it is next to impossible to tell where one leaves off and the other begins.  But now the balance is threatened.  ~
@2356  = ~I fear that if we do not soon discover the source of these disturbances, then all that we have worked for will be destroyed.  The evil that has come to these mountains infects this town like a disease.  As its people suffer, so does the tree suffer from the sickness that attacks the balance, corrupting it with its very presence.~
@2357  = ~Already, the circle of warmth that radiates from the Great Oak has begun recede.  We were forced to abandon the outlying farmsteads as a result of the shrine's fading power.  If we do not take action soon, I am afraid that the life-giving warmth will cease altogether.  Both the Great Oak and the town nestled within its roots will die.  This must not happen.  We need your help.~
@2358  = ~I understand, but the circumstances leave you little choice *but* to get involved.  I needn't remind you that the avalanche that wiped out your expedition, the one that you were fortunate to survive, has blocked the way back to the Ten-Towns.  As I mentioned before, the pass south has been entirely snowed-in.  There is no other way out of this valley.  Your fate and the fate of Kuldahar are intertwined.  You *must* discover the source of the disturbances and restore the balance... or we shall all perish together.~
@2359  = ~I suggest you begin by investigating the Vale of Shadows.  It is a place not far from here.  Darkness has always clung to the floor of the small canyon, as if even the light of the sun were wary of the place.  There are a number of ancient crypts hidden within the shadows of the vale's narrow cliff walls.  There have been rumors of the dead awakening and emerging from their dusty tombs to walk once more amongst men.~
@2360  = ~If these rumors are true, then I suspect that whatever is responsible for disturbing their slumber may be behind the other disturbances as well.  Go to the Vale of Shadows.  Learn what you can about the happenings there.  Then, return here and we shall discuss a course of action.  Good luck and farewell.~
@2361  = ~Please... you must make haste.  Time works *against* us.  We must discover the source of this evil before the balance is altered irrevocably.~ [ARUN_48]
@2362  = ~Ah, you have returned.  What news?  Does the evil we seek lie within the Vale of Shadows?~ [ARUN_49]
@2363  = ~~
@2364  = ~Interesting.  It is impossible to determine exactly what ails him without examining him myself, but I do know of an herbal remedy that may ease his suffering.  If you like, I could tell you the recipe so that you may help him help himself.~ [ARUN_50]
@2365  = ~Tell him to gather a handful of Frostberries that grow throughout these mountains.  He must squeeze the juices from the berries into a pot of boiling tundra grass.  Once mixed, the entire brew must be consumed in order for the pain to subside.~ [ARUN_51]

@2373  = ~I see.  What do you intend to do?~ [ARUN_54]
@2374  = ~I understand your position.  Typically, such vengeful spirits are not known for keeping their word.  But, in this case, I do not think we have much choice.  I urge you to reconsider the spirit's offer in order to learn what it knows - at this point, any information is better than none.~ [ARUN_55]
@2375  = ~I understand your position.  But perhaps there is more to this priestess than you know.  Sometimes, we must choose between the lesser of two evils in order to accomplish good.  This is but one of the ways in which balance is maintained.  I urge you to reconsider the spirit's offer in order to learn what it knows.  At this point, any information is better than none.~
@2376  = ~I understand your position.  But perhaps there is more to this priestess than you know.  If she is indeed a servant of the Frost Maiden, then she may be connected in some way to the unnatural weather in the pass.

@2387  = ~A fortnights past my former band and I, proud delvers all, were involved in an unpleasant quarrel. We were attempting to abscond an ancient tome for our patron from its resting place. This bickering led to cruel humor, vile words and alas, a lake of bloodshed. The book ne'er made it to our merchant friends hands. His love of wordcraft prevails to this day, and all he wants is his sacred grimoire. So the scuttlebutt is that the pay's handsome and worthy of note--rarecut gems, sacks of loot, odd magics. Best of all, the book be not far from where we petty-fog now.~

@2755  = ~~
@2756  = ~Amelia? That dried-up serving wench with the voice like a harpy? Yeah, I know her - and she's right. I *did* buy this place from Eidan, and I'm beginning to see why the ol' dodger wanted to sell this inn and 'vanish' right quick.~
@2757  = ~Why?~
@2758  = ~Well, he stuck me with this hole and not much business to be had. Winter's choked off all the passes, so that means no caravans and no business. I hope ol' Eidan got buried in a snowdrift or used as a chew bone by an ogre. Hmmph. Anyway, the claim's mine, so I got to make do.~
@2759  = ~Well, that's what I wanted to talk about. I found this ring upstairs that casts some doubt on your claims. ~

@2762  = ~~
@2763  = ~~
@2764  = ~Yeah, written in pen and ink, legally binding, every *i* dotted, every *t* crossed for any fool to see. So?~
@2765  = ~Well, that may be, but I found this ring upstairs that casts some doubt on your claims. ~
@2766  = ~Well, Eidan had palsy - but you knew that, right? So if this claim was written to you - of course, assuming that Eidan knew how to write, which he didn't - then the script would hardly be as perfectly written as you say.~
@2767  = ~Just asking. Look, maybe you can help me out - I need a room for the night. ~
@2768  = ~~
@2769  = ~~
@2770  = ~Yeah, well, ol' Eidan must have had someone write it FOR him, then, because everything looks in order to me. It's not unheard of to have others write claims for you. All I know is the claim's *mine.* Now do you want a room or not? If not, then *get out.*~
@2771  = ~I may leave in a bit - just one other thing: I found Eidan's ring upstairs. ~

@2774  = ~~
@2775  = ~~

@2777  = ~This ring has an inscription on the inside that looks like the *real* claim to this inn. Why would you be the owner when this claim says different?~
@2778  = ~Follow me closely inside as well.  I fancy there no be a more dangerous a building in all o' Balders Gate.  Can you think o' anywhere better equipped against thieves, than the thieves' guild itself?  Could teach Durlag's Tower a thing or three, I dare say. ~
@2779  = ~~
@2780  = ~Oh, so now you've stooped to forcing your way into locked containers in people's houses, have you? Before you accuse ME of doing anything wrong, maybe you should look to YOURSELF. You're a PALADIN, right? What's a holier-than-thou soldier doing forcing locks, eh?~
@2781  = ~Oh, so you knew it was locked upstairs? ~
@2782  = ~I can't condone the action, but there may be a larger crime that must be investigated. The fact you knew about this ring makes me even more certain that you are guilty of something - you knew this ring was upstairs all along?~
@2783  = ~Oh, so now you've stooped to forcing your way into locked containers in people's houses, have you? Before you accuse ME of doing anything wrong, maybe you should look to YOURSELF. What are you doing breaking and entering? ~
@2784  = ~~
@2785  = ~Uh... no, no, I didn't know it was locked upstairs. Look, I don't have to explain anyth--~

@2795  = ~While it's good you didn't hurt Eidan, you *shouldn't* have hid the body and falsified the claim.

Most merchants will not wish to purchase this item, or will do so at a very low price, as they see it as a sacred item of Auril the Frostmaiden and likely to attract her followers... and her displeasure.

Created during the ceremonies of the Coming Storm (the onset of winter) to Auril, these robes are specially created to resist flames and allow the wearer to resist any attempt to stop or hold them. Although the priestesses of Auril are naturally resistant to cold and can move through snow and icy rivers with ease, these cloaks amplify the protection of the goddess, allowing the wearer additional cold resistance (which allows a wearer already immune to cold to absorb its power) and even goes so far as to leach the heat from fire attacks directed at the wearer. In addition, the robe may be invoked to allow the wearer to pass over or through any obstacle designed to hold them, whether Web spells, ghoul paralyzation, Hold Person spells and the like.

This spell turns a creature invisible and makes it undetectable by normal vision or infravision. Items dropped or put down by the invisible creature become visible, items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. The spell remains in effect until it is magically broken or dispelled, until the recipient talks to or attacks any creature, or until 4 hours have passed. Thus the invisible being can open doors, eat, climb stairs, etc., but if he attacks or casts a spell, he immediately becomes visible (although the invisibility enables him to attack first).~

He was known for his attempts to prove that priests were charlatans and holy magic was, in actuality, a different form of standard magic.

Some believe that the existence of storms and tremors in nature proves that nature is inherently violent.

There is a simple argument against this, however.  Nature is a gift from the gods, but it functions as an independent system, a science, if you will.  Nature is not inherently violent because disposition towards violence is a property only thinking beings possess.  While there are violent acts in nature, nature is not inherently violent.  Nature is simply nature... "

Fassa the Melancholy (as she is now known) was the head of a band of Selunite adventurers dedicated to destroying undead wherever they found them.  The band was initially quite successful, rarely suffering any casualties.  Tymora's luck could not stay with them forever, though.

In 1156, Fassa and her band entered the Sepulcher of the Dim.  The band knew the Sepulcher was rumored to contain a "leak" to the Negative Material Plane, but they had no idea just how many undead creations were inside.  Mixed in with the seemingly harmless poltergeists and phantoms were powerful spectres and wraiths.  Over a short and chillingly quiet period of several minutes, almost all of Fassa's allies had their vital energy drained away.  Fassa and her remaining companions fled and tried to form a plan of attack.  When they returned on the following night, all of Fassa's former companions had been turned into slave spectres under the control of the master.  She and her few remaining comrades destroyed the master spectre and eventually destroyed the souls of her tormented brethren.  In the end, Fassa was the only one left alive.

Fassa returned to her temple in misery and prayed to Selune that she never forget the agony of that night.  Selune granted her request by causing a ghostly white and blue mace to appear on her bed when the next full moon rose.  Carved into the shaft of the weapon were two words: Never Forget.

Fassa became almost fanatical in her undead hunting in later years.  At the age of thirty-three, tired and bitter, Fassa fell into decline.  On the night of a full moon, she renounced her faith to Selune in front of her superiors and fellow clergy.  Hours later, she threw herself into the Moonsea from a high cliff.  The mace was found in her room and reluctantly kept in the church.  Many years later, the new high priest of the temple decided that the weapon had an unpleasant legacy and should be thrown into the Moonsea.  The history of the mace ends with this event.

"I am simply an amateur when it comes to botany, but I dare say that I know my way around a patch of ivy better than the next man.  Most botanists will attempt to tell you 'rules' about how one should care for their ivy.  Unfortunately, these bumbling buffoons haven't spent enough time researching all of the different types of ivy to learn their subtle differences.  Why, just the other day, some fool on the hill told me that Jangling Bell Ivy should be planted in relatively moist soil next to Blossoming Garters.  As any ivy scholar worth his weight in dirt knows, Blossoming Garters require such a huge amount of water that one would drown the Jangling Bell just by tending to the Garters.  'Moist' does not mean 'soaked.'  I ask you, what will it take to educate these comical jesters of the scientific community?"

"... our principle stance is one of rejection.  The fundamental beliefs of the churches of fury are anathema to our own.  The Gods of Fury stress everything that is selfish, physically abusive, and destructive.  The Malarites care only for proving their temporal power through the senseless butchering of animals.  The Aurilites seem to delight in causing death by freezing whenever possible, removing every shred of heat from their domains.  Priests of Talos simply revel in destruction for its own sake and their own personal pleasure.  Our brothers and sisters in the church of Umberlee cause havoc with the waves for the sole reason of terrifying travelers and fishermen into bowing before their childish god.  As much as we Eldathyn might denounce the beliefs of these religions, there is an even greater question to be asked.  What kind of afterlife can these self-serving priests expect to find in the domains of their self-serving gods?"

Giants come in a number of varieties.  The most common giant race spoken of in Icewind Dale is the mighty Frost Giant.~
@3292  = ~Goblins are extremely common in many non-human areas of Faerun.  The foundation of the "goblinoid" races, many goblins typify everything that humans associate with their cousins: stupidity, greed, and wickedness.  Goblins are not very technologically advanced.  As a result, they frequently raid human settlements for food and other provisions.~
@3293  = ~Typically only found in tropical regions, Lizard Men are primitive bipeds with a well developed social structure and advanced religious beliefs.  Lizard Men tribes are typically led by a Lizard King who is significantly larger and more powerful than his kin.  Lizard Men do not come into conflict with humans often, but their fondness for the taste of human flesh often causes problems.~
@3294  = ~Orcs are the hereditary enemies of goblins and hobgoblins, with whom they often compete for resources.  Reasonably intelligent carnivores, orcs are constantly waging war against other races to maintain their tribes.

Wizards have tried to create orcish variants to take advantage of the race's natural ferocity and strength.~
@3295  = ~Beings from the Elemental Plane of Fire and the Paraelemental Plane of Ice, salamanders are large creatures with the upper bodies of men and the lower bodies of serpents.  Salamanders are typically only found in extremely hot and extremely cold environments.  As these beings are elemental-kin, they radiate small amounts of elemental energy at all times.  They are selfish and cruel creatures that cannot abide being removed from their environment for an extended period of time.~
@3296  = ~Another classification of undead, Skeletal Undead are, perhaps, the most common form of undead foe.  Necromancers and evil priests use skeletal minions as cheap shock troops when less powerful undead are not available.  Some necromancers will use advanced magic to create Skeletal Undead that are tougher, faster, and more resilient than their common counterparts.  Because of their composition, Skeletal Undead are usually very resistant to slashing attacks and almost immune to missile fire.~
@3297  = ~Spectral Undead are often considered to be the most dangerous form of undead because they are typically intelligent and quite powerful.  Lacking a corporeal form, Spectral Undead often cannot be hit by non-magical weapons.  Also, like most undead, they are largely unaffected by charm magic, cold, poison, and illusions.  Spectral Undead are usually tied to the material plane by a curse or magical effect.  Ghosts, shadows, and wraiths are all common examples of Spectral Undead.~
@3298  = ~Monstrously large spiders create problems all over Faerun.  Some giant spiders are magically created and others are naturally occurring, but they all pose a potential threat to humanoid settlements.  There are a wide variety of giant spiders, each with their own strengths and weaknesses.  Giant spiders are feared for their powerful fangs and dangerous poison.~
@3299  = ~Some might argue that trolls are the natural enemy of most rangers.  Inherently violent and aggressive, trolls frequently attack with little or no provocation.  They attack humans and small human settlements regularly, destroying everything in their path.  Trolls are not only feared for their large, powerful limbs, but for their ability to rapidly regenerate most wounds inflicted on them.  Experienced adventurers carry fire and acid with them when expecting trolls.~

With snakelike bodies and vaguely human limbs, yuan-ti hide in secret vaults until the time is right to strike out at their enemies.

During Alerri's early days in the priesthood, he frequently provoked and attacked agents of Sune.  Unfortunately for Alerri, Lady Firehair's followers employed charm magic to cease the Banite's antics.  Once he had been charmed, Alerri was commanded to perform all sorts of embarrassing actions in the streets of Waterdeep.  After many years, Alerri decided to honor his god of hate by creating a suit of armor that would protect him from charm magic.  He communed with the spiritual minions of Bane to discover the materials and rituals necessary for the suit's creation.  Following his master's instructions, he murdered thirteen married couples and had their wedding rings woven into the hem of the mail.  He then killed thirteen elves and bathed in their blood, uttering prayers for thirteen hours.  When he was finished, his armor protected him from the magic of the Sunites and filled him with irrepressible hate.  Alerri went on a crusade against the agents of Sune, Llira, and Hanali Celanil for three years.  His killing spree ended when elven archers and priests of Corellon Larethian laid a trap for him on a road going north from Waterdeep.

@3317  = ~These ancient helms were once common among the Reghedmen barbarians who came to what is now known as Icewind Dale.  The design of the armor is relatively simple: a plain iron helm with a hinged faceplate.  Once the basic construction of the helm had been finished, craftsmen would tool the image of a dead warrior onto the faceplate.  The name of the warrior and a one word description of his death were carved into the forehead of the mask.  The helm was then left in the dead warrior's funeral pyre.  The priests believed that the mask would hide the dead man's fear of the afterlife when he was judged by Tempos.  After a month had passed, the helms of particularly valiant warriors were recovered by the priests.  Over the next few years, the priests praised the valiant warriors by name in their daily rituals.  According to legend, if Tempos found the warrior to be truly valiant, the helm would gain the power to make the wearer immune to fear.  This particular helm bears the ancient name "Siglef" and the word "Axe".

Intercession was made for him by an acquaintance, the wizard Peth of Elturel.  The weapon itself is rather mundane in appearance, which is exactly how Kelhanion wanted it to look.  It has a plain steel blade that meets a similar guard.  The grip of the weapon is wrapped in dark, oiled ogre skin.  The sword has a mild form of empathetic instinct, turning in the wielder's hand to impose itself in the path of melee weapons.  Intercession was lost with Kelhanion when he was slaughtered by over a dozen trolls in the Trollbark Forest.

Apali had killed the priest's great-great grandfather in Chult over a hundred years earlier.  The item is easily recognized because of the red and black banding on the grip and the carved snake heads at the ends of the bow.

The first monk scooped the beautiful lady up in his arms and carried her across the stream, promptly setting her down and continuing on his way.  The second monk remained silent for several minutes as the woman disappeared from view.  Finally he spoke to his brother.

'We shukenja are not supposed to have contact with women!  Why did you pick that woman up so casually and carry her across the stream?'

The first monk replied,

Level: 3
Sphere: Healing 
Range: Touch 
Duration: Permanent 
Casting Time: 5 
Area of Effect: Creature touched 
Saving Throw: None 
When casting this spell and laying his hand upon a creature, the priest causes 14 points of wound or other injury damage to the creature's body to be healed. This healing cannot affect creatures without corporeal bodies, nor can it cure wounds of creatures not living or of extraplanar origin.  
Curing is permanent only insofar as the creature does not sustain further damage; caused wounds will heal - or can be cured - just as any normal injury.

Despite Illep's skill with daggers, the lithe rogue could do little to recover from the axe wound to the upper chest and neck that Brammel dealt him.

@4736  = ~Improved Invisibility 
(Illusion/Phantasm) 
Level: 4
Range: Touch 
Duration: 4 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 4 
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None 
This spell is similar to the Invisibility spell, but the recipient is able to attack, either with missile, melee weapons or spells, and remain unseen. However, telltale traces, a shimmering, allow an observant opponent to attack the invisible spell recipient. These traces are only noticeable when specifically looked for (after the invisible character has made his presence known). Attacks against the invisible character suffer a -4 penalty to attack rolls, and the invisible character's saving throws are made with a +4 bonus.~

@5099  = ~No, no, I think I recognize the general tone.  It's definitely not a human verse, though - the "srrnnn-srnnn" tempo there is more like ocean waves and currents - like sea elves, or sirens.  And you say you've been having strange dreams, too?  Hmmmm.  Tell me about them. ~
@5100  = ~Ah, well, the dreams have been fishing in *me* of late, friend.  So much so I can barely catch a wink before they rouse me from it.  A frustration it is at times; sometimes, it seems like they're more real than the waking world. ~

My father raised no fool, and he told me never to try and fight the spirits that lurk in the North.  I'll hate to leave this place, but it seems I have no choice.  At least I don't have much in the way of belongings... here, take these.  Farewell... and thanks, friend.  ~
@5123  = ~Ah, some fish and a fisherman's knife.  I'll be sure these are disposed of... properly.  Now, if I were you, I'd hurry and leave, without speaking to anyone about this.  Farewell, Jhonen. ~
@5124  = ~Aye, I will.  Of course I will... sorry, it's... well, it's a bit much to be laid upon a fisherman all at once.  I... well, I'd be honored to accept anything she wishes me to have.~

@6075  = ~There may be a way to find that which does not wish to be found through magical means.  However, to accomplish this, I *will* need your help.~ [ARUN_63]
@6076  = ~Of course you do.  I can only show you the path, I would not presume to choose it for you.  You can either choose to help me, thereby helping yourself, or you can choose to allow your fate to be determined by forces you do not understand.~ [ARUN_64]
@6077  = ~Then here is what must be done.  I need you to find an ancient druidic artifact known as the Heartstone Gem.  It is a powerful scrying stone that can be used to divine the location of this evil.  ~ [ARUN_65]

He disappeared into the mountains, along with the artifact, and was never heard from again.~ [ARUN_67]
@6081  = ~A few short years after the theft, there were rumors of a strange cult establishing a temple in these mountains.  It is conceivable that the rogue druid may have been connected in some way with the emergence of this new cult.

Level: 4
Range: None
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None
Through this spell the caster imbues himself with the strength and skill of a fighter of the same level.  The priests strength is set to 18/00, even if it is normally higher, his THACO becomes that of a fighter of the same level, and he gains 1 temporary hit point for every level he has attained.  This will last for the duration of the spell or until successfully dispelled.~

@6091  = ~Ah, this is terrible news.  Did you find any clues as to who these mysterious thieves may be or where they might have taken the Gem?~ [ARUN_72]
@6092  = ~Hmm.  The liquid appears to be a form of undiluted snake venom.  No doubt this priest of Talona was carrying it for use as a poison.  You did well in bringing this to me.  This may be just the clue we needed.~ [ARUN_73]
@6093  = ~You see, once extracted, venom such as this tends to lose its potency rather quickly... usually over the course of a few days.

It was wielded by Aihonen, a distant ancestor of Jhonen the fisherman in Easthaven - the sword has lain at the bottom of the lake for almost a century, waiting to be returned to one of its wielder's bloodline.  How it has been restored to its original state is unknown, but whatever the reason, it looks like a powerful weapon that can help you free Easthaven from Brother Poquelin. 

The blade seems to draw its strength from Lac Dinneshere itself.  As long as the wielder is within a dragon's flight distance of the lake, the blade is a fearsome weapon.

There is no single version of the long sword; the design and length vary from culture to culture, and may vary within the same culture depending on the era.  Among the most common characteristics of all long swords is their length, which ranges from 35 inches to 47 inches.  In the latter case, the blade is known to take up 40 inches of the total length.  Most long swords have a double-edged blade and a sharp point at the tip.  Despite the tip, the long sword is designed for slashing, not thrusting.

It is a staff, however, so if the caster does not have a proficiency in staff weapons, then the Decastave is used at a penalty. The staff also has the power to drain a target of 1-2 hit points on the first strike.

If you are reading this, it means I have met an untimely death.  I would tell you not to grieve for me, but I feel much better thinking that you would.  There are things I must tell you in this letter that I might have told you before.  However, if my death came too soon then I would have never been given the chance.  First off, I am not your biological father, for that distinction lies with an entity known as Bhaal.  The Bhaal that I speak of is the one you know of as a divinity.  In the crisis known as the Time of Troubles, when the Gods walked Faerun, Bhaal was also forced into a mortal shell.  He was somehow forewarned of the death that awaited him during this time.  For reasons unknown to me, he sought out women of every race and forced himself upon them.  Your mother was one of those women, and as you know, she died in childbirth. I had been her friend and on occasion, lover.  I felt obligated to raise you as my own.  I have always thought of you as my child and I hope you still think of me as your father.  You are a special child.  The blood of the Gods runs through your veins.  If you make use of our extensive library you will find that our founder, Alaundo, has many prophecies concerning the coming of the spawn of Bhaal.  There are many who will want to use you for their own purposes.  One, a man who calls himself Sarevok, is the worst danger.  He has studied here at Candlekeep and thus knows a great deal about your history and who you are.

Your progress in disrupting the flow of iron ore does not go as well as it should.  How stupid can you be to allow your kobolds to murder the miners? !   With your presence revealed you should be wary of enemies sent to stop your operation.  Your task is a very simple one; if you continue to show that you can't do the job, you will be replaced.  I will not send the kobolds you have requested as I need all the troops I possess to stop the flow of iron into this region.  With this message I have sent more of the mineral poison that you require.  If you have any problems then send a message to my new contact in Beregost.  His name is Tranzig, and he'll be staying at Feldpost's inn.

TAZOK
~
@6489  = ~[Note for Mulahey 2]My servant Mulahey,
I have sent you the kobolds and mineral poison that you require.  Your task is to poison any iron ore that leaves this mine.  Don't reveal your presence to the miners or you will find yourself swamped by soldiers from the local Amnish garrison.  My superiors have recently hired on the services of the Black talon mercenaries and the Chill.  With these soldiers at my disposal, I should be able to destroy any iron caravans entering the region from the south and east.  I don't want to deal with iron coming from the Nashkel mines so don't fail in your duty.  

TAZOK
~
@6490  = ~[Note for Tranzig]Tranzig, 
I am perplexed as to why Mulahey has not communicated with us in some while.  You are to go to the mines and find out the condition of his operation.  You are also to collect any iron that may have been stolen by the kobolds.  Our next raid will most likely take place at Peldvale, or Larswood, so visit either of those areas and track us back to our camp.

TAZOK

@6491  = ~[Note for Daveaorn 1]Davaeorn,
I have received your request for extra slaves.  They will be sent as soon as possible.  Events go well in Baldur's Gate.  We have purchased one of the western noble estates to use as our base of operations.  It is an ancient building, most likely constructed before the erection of the second wall.  Its construction makes it very defensible against those who would thieve it.  Remember to ask Yeslick if he enjoys his new accommodations.

Our plans go smoothly.  Sarevok has arrived from our headquarters in Ordulin.  He brings news from our superiors;  they are pleased with our progress so far.  I plan to place Sarevok as the commander of our mercenary forces in the region.  He has already sent his subordinate, Tazok, to the Wood of Sharp Teeth to take command of the forces located there.  Things go apace here in Baldur's Gate.  We have placed our first agent among the ranks of the Seven Suns trading coster.

~
@6493  = ~[Note for Daveaorn 3]Davaeorn,
As you have probably heard, the iron poison has begun to take affect around the coast.  With the majority of iron imports being disrupted by Tazok, almost all of it comes from the tainted source in Nashkel.  The Sythillisian uprising in Amn has ensured that no forces from that nation will be able to take action against our mercenary forces.  However, the Flaming Fist has caught several of the Black Talon mercenaries.  All of those captured have claimed allegiance with the Zhentarim and have thus shifted any suspicion away from the Iron Throne.  I have sent Tranzig to work with the mercenaries in transporting the iron to your base in Cloakwood.  He has brought several bags of holding so that he, alone, will make trips into Cloakwood, thereby lessening the chance that Flaming Fist trackers might find your stronghold.

This spell turns a target's blood to flame, doing 3-12 hit points of damage every round and driving the victim berserk with pain. The target gets to save vs. spell every round; if successful, the damage and berserk state are negated.

This spell shapes material from the Demiplane of Shadow into illusionary monsters. These monsters are randomly summoned one by one with Hit Dice between 1 and the level of the spellcaster, until the summoned creatures' Hit Dice total the spellcaster's level. (For example, a 15th level wizard could summon a 10th level creature one round, then the next round the next creature appearing would have 1 through 5 Hit Dice, and so on.) These shadowy creatures have only 20% of the hit points of their real-world counterparts, although their attacks do full damage.

@7282  = ~History of Durpar and Var the Golden:

Durpar and Var the Golden share a common history.  Over three-thousand years ago, these countries were both subject to the great kingdom of Raurin.  When Raurin fell in 2488DR, the countries of Durpar and Var barely survived the destruction.

Rioting, mass destruction, and hatred of nobility were rampant, and the two countries descended into barbarism for over two millennia.  Finally, after most of the barbarian tribes were wiped out by the great empire of Mulhorand, a leader emerged.  Satama, a mere trader, experienced a divine revelation and formulated a new philosophy  All things in the world were connected, were part of a single creation spirit, and all of the gods of the Realms were merely parts of the same entity.  Soon all the Shining Lands embraced the teachings of Satama, and the seeds of civilization were laid in what came to be known as the Lands of the One.

Since the Lands of the One had many natural resources, trade with Mulhorand and Luiren became a way of life.  Merchants were honored above all.  In time, the Maharajah of Durpar and the Rajah of Var were replaced with a Council of Merchants.  During this time the land suffered occasional raiding attacks from the horsewomen of Dambrath, and had many skirmishes with the neighboring countries of Estagund and Ulgarth.

In 1023 DR, after an armed peace had been worked out with Ulgarth, the council of merchants decided that something needed to done about the raiders from Estagund who were hurting trade with other countries.  War was an inconvenience, but interrupting trade was life-threatening.

Jeradeem, the richest merchant in the lands, was given power to negotiate a settlement.  During these negotiations he proved, at least in the eyes of the Durparians, that he was indeed the master trader he seemed.  Estagund had just tried a foolish invasion of Dambrath.  The vengeful female leaders of that land wiped out nearly every able-bodied fighting man they sent.  The monsters of Veldorn were causing problems, and Estagund was going through a famine.

It was here that Jeradeem showed his fine merchant's instincts.  He could not pass up such an advantage, and began bargaining the most outrageous trade of all time.  He met with the leaders of Estagund, a fearful king and his nobles, and explained the advantages of Durparian life and the philosophy of the Adama, the oneness of all things.  He bargained for days until finally the king made the trade.  He purchased the whole of Estagund for the countries of Durpar and Var at the price of 24 gems.  He also promised protection, and help for their integration into the Durparian way of life.  Thus were formed the Shining Lands.

Within a hundred years, the three countries shared a common way of life, and with the added strength and resources of Estagund, Durparian merchants increased their trading range.  They roamed as far east as Kara-Tur, as far north as the Sea of Fallen Stars, and west to Dambrath and Halruaa.  At the present time, with the newly discovered lands of Maztica and Zakhara beckoning, the future looks bright.~
@7283  = ~History of Tethyr:

For the past 1500 years, Tethyr has had a single, strong royal family ruling with absolute power.  When a king died or became incapacitated, his oldest son took the throne.  As the family trees of those close to power became more intertwined and complicated, there were the inevitable wars of succession and bickering over which second cousin was the "true" heir to the throne.  Civil wars were brief, however, and once the fighting was over the system returned to normal (until the next major dispute in a few hundred years or so).

The established re-occurring cycle was broken 10 years ago.  The current ruling family had been in power for over 350 years, so long that they had dropped their own family name centuries ago (no one even remembers it now) and simply called themselves Tethyr.  King Alemander IV was comfortably ruling from Castle Tethyr, and the country seemed happy enough, but there was a broad current of dissatisfaction among the people of Tethyr.  Non-humans were forbidden by law to own land, and since most rights and privileges accorded citizens were based on land ownership, they became second-class citizens as well.  Things were especially bad for elves, who were driven deep into the Forest of Tethir by royal armies.  Alemander IV took land away from rightful owners and gave it to nobles who promised larger contributions to the royal treasury.  These social and economic inequities, coupled with several harsh winters and bad harvests in a row, made the time ripe for a change.

It takes more than just a couple of lousy winters to depose a king however; It takes treachery as well.  In the case of the fall of House Tethyr it took an ambitious general and impatient royal heir.  Prince Alemander grew tired of waiting for the robust Alemander IV to make room for him, so he struck a deal with General Nashram Sharboneth, commander of the king's largest army.  While Sharboneth marched his army toward Tethyr, bringing along a sizable group of angry peasants recruited with the promise of land reform, the would-be Alemander V downplayed alarming reports from the king's spies and advisors, silencing the most persistent permanently through murder or exile.  By the time Sharboneth's army arrived and laid siege to Castle Tethyr, it was too late for loyalists to help.

As Sharboneth launched a direct assault on the castle (using the expendable peasants as shock troops), a handful of elite soldiers let in a secret entrance by the prince would eliminate key guards and open the gates.  At the same time, the prince (one of the few people allowed to see the king directly) would murder his father.  A fire set by the elite troops would destroy the evidence of treachery and the general and the prince would emerge from the conflagration and announce a new, joint government.

The plan was executed perfectly, but only up to a point.  Sharboneth double-crossed the prince; his men were much too efficient in setting the castle ablaze, and Prince Alemander (along with most of his fellow conspirators) died horribly in the fire.  At about the same time, a spy planted on the general's inner staff by the equally duplicitous Alemander murdered the general and dissolved his body with a powerful acid before anyone could come to his aid.

To make matters worse, everyone had underestimated the resentment the people felt for the royal family.  Once Castle Tethyr began to fall, there was no holding back the mob.  In one night, the proudest, strongest castle in all the country was reduced to a smoking ruin.  Everything of value - fine tapestries, plates and silverware, furniture, jewelry, weapons, clothes, armor, paintings, statues, etc.- was either stolen, burned, or just ripped apart and stomped into the dust.

As news of the fall of the royal family spread, so did the chaos.  In what is now known as the "Ten Black Days of Eleint," anyone known (or even suspected) of blood connection to the royal family was put to the sword.  This led to some darkly humorous moments, as social climbers who had bragged just a week before of being a sixth cousin twice removed of a royal aunt tried in vain to convince an angry mob that they were "only kidding."

The nobles who were the biggest supporters of the royal family also came under attack, and some baronial keeps fell.  Local leaders who had adequately distanced themselves from the Tethyr family, or were popular enough (or feared/strong enough), survived.  These surviving nobles became the initial players in the fight to decide the fate of Tethyr.

One thing was certain; any leader or type of government that too closely resembled rule under the Tethyrs would not be accepted.  "Royalist" became a dirty word in Tethyr society.  The power struggle continues to this day, and there is no sign of it ending anytime soon.~
@7284  = ~History of Amn:  

Amn has the good fortune to have abundant natural resources; some would say Amn is the richest land on the continent. This has worked in Amn's favor for generations, because even if they were conquered, the new masters would be gentle, looking to gain wealth from the land, rather than to put it to the torch. 

Amn has been a center of trade and commerce for as long as anyone can remember. Oral traditions handed down from father to son tend to support the theory that Amn has been a trade center for at least 800 years. Unfortunately, written records are difficult to find and often incomplete. It would seem the typical Amnish citizen was too busy trying to fill their coffers to write down events of the day. 

Amn has always been more interested in the present and the future than the past, and this makes an accurate history difficult. The best records, the business papers of the oldest trading companies, are jealously guarded.  The fear of revealing "trade secrets" is stronger than the call of history, so the average citizen knows very little about Amn's past. 

It appears that the Amn of 100 years ago was very much like the Calimshan of today.  Each major city was basically an independent entity, banding together for defense when necessary, and fighting for control of territory and profitable trade routes the rest of the time.  A particularly brutal trade war began 24 years ago, with each city exacting prohibitive tariffs on goods imported from the others. The trade war escalated, and city troops began to raid caravans sponsored by other cities. In a matter of months commerce was brought to a halt, a number of cities were under siege, and war threatened to engulf the entire region. 

Into the breach stepped a young merchant named Thayze Selemchant. Thayze was smart, charismatic, and very well connected (the Selemchant trading house was one of the oldest and richest in Athkatla.) He secretly contacted representatives of the five other richest merchant houses in Amn, and started to plan. 

The first part of the plan involved the careful sprinkling of rumors about outside threats.  One involved a pirate invasion from the Nelanther, another was about a massing of orcs just on the other side of the Cloud Peaks. Thayze even started a rumor about an elf army in the Forest of Tethir, ready to pounce on a divided Amn.  None of the rumors were true, but they began to turn people's thoughts toward unity, not war. 

Thayze knew that if he and the other members of his council were to take control of Amn, they would need broad-based popular support. Tensions between cities and merchant houses were still high, so to get that support, Selemchant and the others agreed to drop their family names and never use them again. 

When news of a "Council of Six" spread throughout the land, many people accepted their rule.  A group that would unite Amn under one rule, governing for the benefit of all instead of one city or trading company over another, was indeed a welcome change.  The Council raised an army (at great personal expense) to quell the few pockets of resistance that remained, and have been in total control of Amn for the past 22 years.

@7285  = ~History of Calimshan:

Calimshan is older than either of the other Empires of the Sands, first settled over 7,000 years ago by the Djen, a humanoid race from the Elemental Plane of Air. These Djen were known to be very magical, and during the course of their rule they developed many new spells previously not available in the Plane of Air.

The Djen prospered for over 1,000 years in Calimshan, but their reign was ended by an invasion of creatures and minions from the Plane of Fire.  Some say this is where the bitter hatred between djinni and efreeti started, though others contend this was just a result of a hatred that was already there.  Whatever the cause, the battle was long and bloody, and took over 100 years to complete. The Djen finally routed the attackers, but were greatly weakened in the attempt. They slowly declined, and the last mention of the Djen is just under 6,000 years old.

For the next 4,000 years Calimshan was dominated by nomadic tribes of humans. Tribes from various places - Chult, the Shaar, The Shining Plains, Chondath, even Amn and Cormyr - took turns dominating, only to be conquered by the next, nearly identical tribe.

Slowly, the nomadic nature of Calimshan began to change.  As explorers and traders from Amn, Waterdeep, and Cormyr discovered the wonders of the area, some tribes began to settle down and develop new means of support, like fishing, farming, or trading. These communities began to band together for mutual protection, and soon a civilization was born.  It was only 1,300 years ago that the Shoon Empire (now called Iltkazar) came into being.

The Shoons were a grand and glorious empire, and their excesses were the foundation of Calishite snobbery today. They grew wise and powerful in the ways of magic, and ships and caravans bearing the Shoon flag traveled across the Forgotten Realms.  Shoon himself, a particularly powerful mage, created a book of great power during this time called the Tome of the Unicorn.  The exact location of the Tome has been lost in time, but since the book is 2' by 3' and made of pure metal, it is likely to still be around... somewhere.

900 years ago the Shoon empire abruptly vanished. A great magical upheaval was suspected at first, but learned mages of other lands dispute the claim.   A force that great they say, would have disturbed magical powers and beings throughout the Realms, and that didn't happen.  Sages who have studied the Shoon at great length have reached no definite conclusions, but the most popular theories today center around a plague or disease that decimated the population.

Today, the Shoon impact on Calimshan is still great. The grandeur of that empire is responsible, more than anything else, for the strong national character of Calimshan today. The ruins of the Shoon's greatest city, Monrativi Teshy Mir, can still be found in the wilderness to the west of the edge of the Forest of Mir (see below for more on Monrativi Teshy Mir).

Since the fall of Shoon, no force or people has risen to solely dominate the land.  There are a half dozen or so major cities, each of which exerts its own power over its own area.  About 170 years ago, a man in Calimport amassed a large army and declared himself "Pasha" over the land.  Before that army could march, however, the representatives of each major city met and agreed to recognize the Pasha's authority in limited areas, and to pay a small tribute to him; enough to pay for the works the Pasha was expected to do.  The oldest son of each pasha inherits the title; if there is no son, the mayors of each large city select a new one.  The current Pasha, Rashid Djenispool, has ruled for over 18 years, and is the grandson of a pasha elected by the mayors of Calimshan 44 years ago.~
@7286  = ~History of Estagund:

Estagund history follows a different path than those of Durpar and Var.  The Gunders were conquered in 551 DR by Reinhar I, warchief of the Arkaiuns of Dambrath.  It regained its independence when Reinhar was slain by the Halruaan archmage Mycontil, though the country soon degenerated into a group of small independent city states.

Skirmishes with Var, and between the city-states, continued for several centuries until a king once again united the country.  King Bornial was a skilled ruler, and under him Estagund began to prosper.  His descendants did not share his wisdom, and in 1053 DR, King Selkarin more than illustrated this.  He had failed to conquer Durpar, and Veldorn resisted his challenges.  An avowed misogynist, Selkarin turned his attentions to the matriarchy of Dambrath.  He led a large fleet to attack Dambrath, taking extreme losses, including his own life.  Selkarin died childless, so his brother Seltarir was crowned King.  The new ruler faced a country with most of its fighting men gone, and an unforeseen problem: famine.  The famine was caused by a blight that wiped out nearly all the year's crops in Estagund.  This made him eager for a deal posed by the Durparian merchant Jeradeem, and in a legendary trade the entire country of Estagund was sold.  Contrary to popular rumor, Seltarir did not trade away the country for 24 pearls.  In actuality he received diamonds worth almost a million gold pieces.  The sudden wealth gave him an instant seat on the council of merchants, so he retained a measure of rule in addition to his fortune.  Chaka Seltarir is still the richest chaka in Estagund to this day.  In the years that followed, the Gunders began rebuilding their lives under their new circumstance, and now they compete on equal footing with the merchants of Durpar and Var. ~
@7287  = ~History of Gondegal the Lost King:  

Arabel, long under the dominion of Cormyr, for a time became the center of a swordsman's empire.  This swordsman was Gondegal, the Lost King, who in the Year of the Dragon (1352 DR) attempted to carve a kingdom for himself centered on Arabel.  it was to extend north to the Desertsmouth Mountains; south and west of Wyernwater and the farms outlying from Eveningstar; and east to Tilver's Gap and the mountain passes. 

In the years following, people would say that Gondegal's reach was no longer than his blade.  He could not hold any of the territory against the might of Cormyr, Sembia, Daggerdale, Tilverton, and several of the other Dales -all of whom he drew the blood and ire of in the making of his throne.  

Gondegal ruled for less than a season, though he reigned officially for scarcely eight days.  The remainder of his rule was spent fighting here and there against one foe or another in the lands he claimed.  His troops were largely mercenary, and his treasury of seized goods was small and soon gone.  One night Gondegal's force simply melted away before the advancing troops of Cormyr, and was gone.  King Azoun IV retook Arabel on that morn without wetting a blade. 

No one has ever found the body of Gondegal; he is known to have fled north and then east via Teshwave, but then his fate becomes a matter of conflicting rumor and legend.  Some believe he still lives with a score or more of loyal followers, keeping court in the wilds somewhere, a careful and ruthless bandit who takes care that none survive his attacks to carry tales anywhere.  When entire caravans vanish at times anywhere between the High Dale and far-off Impiltur, he is blamed by talk in the taverns.  

Gondegal was said to be a tall, gray-haired warrior of considerable personal skill and intelligence.  His badge was a gray wolf's head, face on, with red eyes.  Caraban guards often warn merchants to beef up the escort on a particular caravan, " else thy gold'll soon be gilding Gondegal's throne."  Gondegal was an impeccable swordsman and somewhat chaotic in his self professed neutral alignment.  If he does indeed yet live, the magic or treasure he carries, and who his allies might be, are all unknown.

Gondegal's reign had a great influence on the King of Cormyr, at that time in his second decade of rule.  Not only was Azoun forced to put down an effective rebellion in his own country, he was forced to pay more attention to matters outside Suzail, to become the ruler of a nation as opposed to a city-state.  Further, the bloodless assault on Arabel was Azoun's first true experience at the head of his army, and the joy of "freeing" the people of Arabel is one that remains with him.

@7288  = ~History of the Chosen of Mystra:  

The reason why Mystra, the Goddess of Magic, invested a portion of her divine might in mortals is not known.  One of the more popular theories, and one that is gaining more support in light of the goddess's other actions during that period,  is that Mystra foresaw the Time of Troubles (and her own passing at the hands of Helm) and chose to give some of her power to mortals in order to ensure that her successor (the female mage Midnight, as it turned out) would have a number of nearly immortal allies in the struggle against the schemes of the gods (the now dead Bane, Myrkul, and Bhaal) who precipitated the Time of Troubles by stealing the Tablets of Fate.  The theory goes on to suggest that Mystra informed Azuth at approximately the Year of the Rising Flame (0 DR), more than 1,300 years before the Time of Troubles, that some of her power must be put into the hands of mortals who would then become known as Mystra's Chosen.  This power would sleep within the bodies of those mortals, allowing Mystra to call on it only with their permission.  It would give the Chosen the innate ability to heal quickly, and would give them life spans far greater than those of ordinary mortals.  Mystra speculated that these mortals might be able to call on her power and thereby gain some special abilities, but that these powers would not rival those of a deity. (See "Powers" below.) 

The Goddess of All Magic then began to select mortals she thought to be suitable.  One of the first was the young mage Elminster, and she also singled out a promising wizard named Khelben Arunsun.  Both have proved to be worthy and capable receptacles of her power, but Mystra's other early attempts to invest her power in living humans were unsuccessful, and she came to realize that only very few mortals were of stern enough substance to contain such power within themselves without being destroyed or corrupted.  Even though some people aside from Elminster and Khelben may have possessed the requisite strength, it is possible that having lived for years prior to being visited by Mystra had set them on a path from which they were not able to deviate.  Whatever the reason, the problem needed to be solved.  To get around the difficulty, Mystra devised a plan to use herself as a vessel to breed individuals who could be nurtured and acclimated to her power from the very beginnings of their lives. 

For the father of these individuals, she picked the best example of human stock she could find: Domal Silverhand, a nobleman and a former Harper who lived near Neverwinter.  Mystra then possessed the body of Elue Shundar, a half-elven sorceress whom Dornal was already attracted to.  Mystra revealed her presence and her plan to Elue, who happily and eagerly agreed to have the goddess share her body.  Elue had been reluctant, but under the influence of Mystra the woman became a seductress, and Domal found his advances being suddenly returned with great fervor. 

Dornal and Mystra/Elue were wed in the Year of Drifting Stars (760 DR).  The first of seven daughters, Anastra Sylune, was born the following winter.  Sylune's six sisters emerged at one-year intervals thereafter: Endue Alustriel, Ambara Dove, Ethena Astorma (she prefers the shortened "Storm" these days), Anamanue Laeral, Alassra Shentrantra (known today as the Simbul), and Er'sseae Qilue.  These siblings have become known in Realmsian lore as the Seven Sisters. 

Domal, who had been kept in the dark about his wife's true nature through the years (presumably because Mystra didn't want to risk losing his services), was disappointed and nearly distraught by the time his sixth child was born; He had always wanted sons as well as daughters.  More importantly, he was seeing his wife deteriorate right before his eyes. The strain of coexisting with the goddess all these years had turned Elue into a withered shell - in essence a lich, clinging to life only because Mystra's power was within her. 

When Elue was carrying the seventh child, Dornal consulted a priest who told him his wife had been possessed by an entity of great magical power.  To spare both of them any further agony, he attempted to slay his wife's physical form by severing her head from her body. 

As soon as he had done this, Mystra was forced to reveal herself to him, and she went on to explain her scheme.  Just as she had worried would happen, Dornal was aghast at how he and his wife had been used by the goddess.  He turned his back on the corpse of his wife, abandoned his lands and his children, and vanished into the North.  Mystra bore him no ill will, and in fact protected him for the final 30 years of his life.  When Domal finally did meet his end he called out to Mystra, and the goddess granted him continued existence as her servant.  Now known as the Watcher, Domal Silverhand travels the world unseen by mortals on a continuing mission to locate candidates to swell the ranks of the Chosen and to identify possible threats to Mystra and her minions.

@7289  = ~History of Shadowdale - The Fall, of Azmaer, Last Drow Marshal of the Twisted Tower:

The drow rule of Shadowdale lasted until the early 900s Dale Reckoning, when the increased human population in the area brought the dark elves into conflict with their now more numerous neighbors.  The humans were the Dalesmen who a millennium earlier had crossed the Dragon Reach and made peace with the elves of Myth Drannor, settling at the borders of the great woods that was the elven home.  The drow soon found themselves under continual attack, and most of those who held overground settlements retreated back below.  The last powerful drow leader was Azmaer, the marshal of the Twisted Tower in its last drow-held days.  Azmaer oversaw the last retreat of the drow holdings in the face of a human uprising, and held the citadel against a year-long siege.  With supplies and slaves brought up from the Underdark directly into the tower, the drow could have conceivably held out forever; However, a human slave (family histories in the Dales indicate a number of possible individuals) poisoned the well in the Tower and the citadel was easily overrun.  Azmaer's body was not found among the dead, leading some to believe that he escaped back into the depths to rejoin his people.  Noting the fact that he would have had to explain to his matriarch how he lost Shadowdale, it is much more likely that, should Azmaer have survived, he went into voluntary exile, hiding from both human and drow.  Given that this occurred only 400 years ago, it is certainly possible that Azmaer still lives.~
@7290  = ~History of Shadowdale - Ashaba Becomes First Lord of Shadowdale:

Upon taking the Twisted Tower and removing the drowish yoke from the people, the Dalesmen had fully established the Dale of Shadowdale, with its seat of power in the tower itself.  Its first lord was a water wizard who had aided in the final attack;  Ashaba, who was great in age when he ascended, and ruled peacefully for 40 years thereafter.  It is said that Ashaba realized he was dying and turned himself to water, merging with the river.  Since that time, the river, the ford, and the Twisted Tower all bear his name.  Before passing on Ashaba chose one of his trusted lieutenants as the new lord of Shadowdale.  Presented to the people of the Dale, he was made the new lord by acclamation.  In an additional honor, the pendant worn by Ashaba was thereafter recognized as a symbol of the lordship in the Dalelands, and was possessed by each of the successive lords following.~
@7291  = ~History of Shadowdale -  Joadath and the Tyrist Massacre: 

The past hundred years have been an example of the best and worst of the lords of Shadowdale.  All have been nonnative to the Dalelands, though all made the land their home.  A century ago the lord of the Dales was one Joadath, a stiff-necked agnostic who denied the power of any god, good or evil, and used force to back up his beliefs.  During this time there was a great deal of religious persecution, including a massacre of Tyrists on Watcher's Knoll.  Joadath was eventually killed by a beast of the nether planes summoned by parties unknown, which then proceeded to rampage through the Dale.  The beast was killed and Shadowdale rescued by the spellcasters Aumry and Sylune.  Aumry was proclaimed lord by acclamation.

@7292  = ~History of Shadowdale -  Aumry Rules in Peace: 

The longest period of peaceful rule was by Lord Aumry and his wife Sylune (better known as the Witch of Shadowdale).  They ruled over the community for forty years, a period of extended peace with their neighboring dales, nations, and the elven peoples.  It was this very peace and power which made the Dale the target for attacks and sabotage by the Black Network (Zhentarim).  They sought (and still seek) to control the trade from the Moonsea to the Sword coast, and desired to make Shadowdale a vassal state of Zhentil Keep.  Lord Aumry's rule ended tragically when he was assassinated by Zhentish agents.
~
@7293  = ~History of Shadowdale -  Jyordhan the False Lord: 

 Lord Aumry was assassinated by Zhentarim agents, who in turn were captured and killed by the warrior Jyordhan.  Jyordhan, with the Pendant of Ashaba in hand(the symbol of the lordship in the Dales), proceeded to present himself as the new lord, and was so acclaimed by the people.  It was unknown to the people that Jyordhan was also an agent of the Zhentarim, and that the entire proceeding had actually been a ruse. 

Jyordhan abandoned the Twisted Tower, instead establishing himself in Castle Krag east of Shadowdale.  His court was soon overrun with agents of the Black Network.  When the people eventually revolted, Zhentil Keep sent peace-keeping forces to maintain Jyordhan's rule.  Sylune, now aware of the deception but a firm pacifist, did her best to keep the Dale healthy and intact during Jyordhan's evil rule.

@7294  = ~History of Shadowdale -  Khelben Kills Jyordhan: 

Lord Jyordhan's rule of Shadowdale ended when he encountered Khelben Arunsun, also called the Blackstaff.  The story at the time was that Jyordhan accepted an invitation from Khelben to visit Waterdeep, and there he took ill and died.  In reality, Jyordhan ambushed Khelben as the mage was leaving Shadowdale, and the Blackstaff killed him.  In either case, Khelben took hold of the Pendant of Ashaba (the symbol of the lordship in the Dales) and returned to Waterdeep with it, promising to send a suitable candidate for lordship to the Dales.  Jyordhan had ruled for five years, and without his advocacy, Castle Krag was abandoned and the Zhentil Keep troops routed.  Jyordhan's previously chosen successor was a Melvauntan named Lyran, but without the Pendant this individual was considered a pretender to the throne. ~
@7295  = ~History of Shadowdale - Lords Accepted by Acclamation: 

This acclamation of the people has formed the basis for choosing the lord of Shadowdale since the routing of the evil Lord Jyordhan by Khelben Blackstaff.  Usually a predecessor will step down as opposed to dying in office, and his chosen successor will be approved by the populace at large.  This system has had its drawbacks, as will be shown below, but in general, it has served the independent, self-willed people of the Dale very well.  They have avoided the "genetic lottery of which good bureaucracies and bad kingships are made" (a quote from the venerable Elminster).  The symbol of the lordship is the Pendant of Ashaba, a device owned by the original wizard, and used to determine the rightful lord of the Dale. 
~
@7296  = ~History of Shadowdale - The Time of No Lords:

During the period when Khelben Blackstaff held the Pendant of Ashaba(the symbol of the lordship in the Dales), Sylune (wife of the murdered Lord Aumry) was the de facto ruler of Shadowdale, though these years were known as the Time of No Lords.  Sylune and an adventuring company known as Manes' Band were responsible for driving out the Zhentil Keep forces and keeping at bay the monsters in the area.  The Twisted Tower, the traditional seat of leadership, remained uninhabited following it's abandonment by the evil Lord Jyordhan, and neither Sylune nor the companions of Mane's Band wished to assume the mantle of leader.  With time, Mane's Band passed on to other lands and adventures.~
@7297  = ~History of Shadowdale - Doust Sulwood Becomes Lord of Shadowdale: 

Three winters following his defeat of the evil Lord Jyordhan, Khelben  Blackstaff found a suitable candidate to assume leadership of the Dales, or rather a group of candidates.  They were the Knights of Myth Drannor, so named to show their interest in the elven territories and their connection with the elven peoples, and Khelben gave them the Pendant of Ashaba(the symbol of the Lordship) in return for services rendered to himself and to Shadowdale.  Their leader, the ranger Florin Falconhand, refused the honor of the lordship.  It was therefore passed to Doust Sulwood, who was made the new lord with the support of Florin and Sylune(wife of the murdered Lord Aumry), and apparently also the secret support of Khelben as well. 

Doust reoccupied the Twisted Tower, driving out the last agents of the Black Network.  He also reinstituted many of Ashaba's democratic ideals, including the Lord's Court where all citizens may speak freely and air their grievances without threat of reprisal.  Doust ruled for five years and proved to be a capable ruler, beloved by the people.  The regular presence of the Knights of Myth Drannor did much to ensure the protection of the area, particularly against incursions by Lyran Nanther the Pretender.  Lyran was to have been Jyordhan's named replacement, but with the Zhentarim routed there is little validity to the claim.
~
@7298  = ~History of Shadowdale - Elminster Moves to Shadowdale: 

It is of note that during the time that Doust Sulwood of the Knights of Myth Drannor assumed the role of Lord of Shadowdale, Elminster took up residence in the area.  A semi-regular visitor up to that time, he took possession of a low, abandoned tower at the foot of the Old Skull, and declared himself to be officially in retirement.  The nature of that retirement varies from active involvement in local affairs to long-term vacations on other planes.  The natives of the Dale have come to the understanding that they cannot always count on the powerful mage being in residence in times of need or danger, but when he is present in these circumstances his aid is usually given.  
~
@7299  = ~History of Shadowdale - Doust Chooses Mourngrym Amcathra to Succeed Him:

Doust Sulwood, recommended to the position by Khelben Blackstaff, ruled Shadowdale as lord for five years.  "Seems like a millennium," he was oft known to have reported, and the tedium of court life and the lure of adventure eventually caused him to retire his position and rejoin the Knights of Myth Drannor in regular adventuring.  He handed the Pendant of Ashaba (symbol of the Lordship) on to one of the younger Knights, a Waterdhavian noble named Mourngrym Amcathra.  Mourngrym had been dispatched by Khelben from Waterdeep for other purposes, but Doust liked both the young man's straightforward honesty and his willingness to shoulder the burden of protecting the small community from myriad dangers.  Time has proven this choice a wise one.~
@7300  = ~History of Shadowdale - Shaerl and Mourngrym Meet and Marry: 

The implications of Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun "choosing" the last two lords of Shadowdale (Doust Sulwood and Mourngrym Amcathra) were not lost on the Dale's powerful neighbor to the south, Cormyr. An agent was sent northward to divine Mourngrym's true intentions and to guarantee the Dale's continued good relationship with the throne of the Purple Dragon.  The agent was a rogue named Shaerl Rowanmantle, sent by Vangerdahast (though all paperwork on this matter has been curiously incinerated in Suzail, so all is hearsay and tale).  Shaerl discovered more than she intended and fell in love with young Mourngrym.  The two married and became the lord and lady of Shadowdale.  Shaerl's loyalty is now to her husband and to the land they co-rule.  This was probably not the intention of the Cormyreans. 
~
@7301  = ~History of Shadowdale -  Mourngrym's Rule:

Since being recommended to the position by outgoing Lord Doust Sulwood, Lord Mourngrym Amcathra's rule of Shadowdale has been less peaceful than he had hoped.  The First Battle of Shadowdale occurred in the Year of the Prince (1357 DR), and involved Daleland forces routing those of Lyran the Pretender.  Lyran has made repeated attempts to gain the Lordship, as was intended by the former Zhentish puppet, Lord Jyordhan.  While significant, this battle pales when compared to the larger battle fought on the same site between Bane-led Zhentil Keep forces and the Dales during the Time of Troubles (1358 DR/0 PR).  When the Battle of Shadowdale is referred to (without a number), it usually means this second battle.  In addition, Mourngrym has had to deal with a large number of skirmishes, incursions, a possible invasion from below, explosions, and other sundry disasters. 

Mourngrym and Shaerl have one child, Scotti, who is now nine winters old.  By the customs of the area, he is not considered the heir apparent, and another suitable warrior or mage may take the reins of power of the small community.  Most feel that Mourngrym will hold the Pendant until his son has reached his majority, then abdicate in young Scotti's favor once he takes his grown name.  If this happens, it will be the first occasion of the lordship of Shadowdale passing down through a family.

@7302  = ~History of the North - The First Flowering:  

For millennia, gold elves dwelt in Illefarn (where Waterdeep now stands) and Eaerlann (along the River Shining).  From their ornate forest cities they traded with emerging human nations like Netheril and Illusk and repulsed the attacks of the goblin races.  Meanwhile, dwarven clans united as the nation of Delzoun, named for the dwarf who forged the union.  The nation, existing primarily underground, extended from the Ice Mountains to the Nether Mountains.  Silver Moon Pass was its western border and the Narrow Sea its eastern shore.  Orcs came from north of the Spine of the World but were turned back in great slaughter by the elves.  To this day, this is the homeland and stronghold for orcs and similar races. 
~
@7303  = ~History of the North - The Crown Wars:  

Humans immigrated in bands from the Shining Sea and up to the Sword Coast.  They became seafarers, striking out across the waves to the Moonshaes, Mintarn, Ruathym, and the northern islands.  Elves engaged in an unceasing war against each other with the humans and orcs taking over the resulting ruins.  Perhaps the greatest calamity to befall the Fair Folk was the Dark Disaster, a killing magic that took the form of a dark, burning cloud.  It enshrouded the kingdom of Mieyritar, and when it faded away some months later, not an elf lived - nor were trees left; only an open, blasted moor: the High Moor. 

All was not dark for the elves. Although in retreat, as barbarian humans and orc hordes grew in strength, their power rose in the Elven Court and Evereska (remaining a stronghold to this day).  They conceived of cooperation between dwarves, kindly humans, and other elves for mutual survival against orcs, marauding humans, and the tide of beasts (ogres, bugbears, trolls, goblins, gnolls, and other nonhuman creatures) led by the rising power of giants.  Astonishingly, in at least three places - the Fallen Kingdoms and the cities of Silverymoon and Myth Drannor - they succeeded with shining grace. 

To the east, on the sandy shores of the calm and shining Narrow Sea, human fishing villages grew into small towns and then joined together as the nation of Netheril.  Sages believe the fishing towns were unified by a powerful human wizard who had discovered a book of great magic power that had survived from the Days of Thunder - a book that legend calls the Nether Scrolls.  Under this nameless wizard and those who followed, Netheril rose in power and glory, becoming both the first human land in the North and the most powerful.  Some say this discovery marked the birth of human wizardry, since before then, mankind had only shamans and witch doctors.  For over 3,000 years Netheril dominated the North, but even its legendary wizards were unable to stop their final doom.  
~
@7304  = ~History of the Bell in the Depths:

One of the great and mysterious sites in the Moonsea area, the Bell in the Depths, is connected with legendary Northkeep, an island kingdom that was the first great citadel of humankind in these cold lands.  Northkeep was of great and magical city, and it was under the protection of these magics that humanity first began to press back the orc hordes and take command or the sea.

The power of Northkeep made it an obvious target for orcs, giants, and other evil races, however these creatures were not inclined towards sea actions, and Northkeep seemed safe until the day when (according to legend) 40,000 inhuman mages, shamans, witch doctors, and priests of all foul races gathered on the northern shore of the Moonsea and began to chant, bringing the vengeance of their gods down upon the human interlopers.  The gods (at least some of them) came and destroyed their priests for disturbing them, but also sank Northkeep beneath the waves.

The upper reaches of Northkeep - its slender, now-broken spires - can be seen beneath the water by boats that sail nearby.  This is not attempted often, however, as the region is said to be haunted by the original defenders of Northkeep, seeking company in their watch over the Cold Lands.  On fog-ridden nights the bells of the tallest towers, despite being submerged, can be heard as far away as Hillsfar.  ~
@7305  = ~History of the Red Ravens:

One of the few long-standing mercenary companies that operate in Cormyr, the Rad Ravens have a strength on paper of 110 swords, but can easily triple that number with new hires if they get a sufficiently large contract.  They have been kept on retainer by the government of Cormyr with the stated purpose of cleaning out the Stonelands to the north.  They have been moderately successful in this goal, but the Stonelands are still far from being a safe territory.

The Red Ravens are commanded by Rayanna the Rose, a veteran of the Horde crusade.  They are noted for their honesty and trustworthiness, as they don not wish to jeopardize their royal charter.  Most of their troops are armed with studded leather and carry long swords.  They charge 200 gold pieces per week for the services of their 110-being unit.  Their symbol is a red raven amulet.~
@7306  = ~History of Dambrath:

The nation of Dambrath was formed out of a barbarian kingdom almost a half-millennium ago by a powerful alliance of priestesses of Loviatar and the drow from the city of T'lindhet.

In 211 DR, fleeing from the destruction of the homeland by the then-great kingdoms of Unther and Mulhorand, four tribes of barbarians entered Dambrath.  They found a coast where the dolphins danced and plains where the grass was long.  They roamed from the borders of the Walls of Halruaa as far east as the current borders of Estagund.  They soon became known as the Arkaiun, or people of the wind.

In 545 DR a great warchief, Reinhar, arose to lead the tribes.  The halflings of Luiren were quickly enslaved, and several of the coastal cities of Durpar were captured or razed.  Estagund fell to his rule, and eventually Reinhar turned his attention to Halruaa.

An army of 40,000 horsemen and a fleet of 50 ships mounted a coordinated attack, and even though Reinhar was able to get beyond the Walls of Halruaa and occupy the cities of Mithel, Galdel, and Zalsuu, their magics proved to be more than a match for the invaders.  Reinhar was finally defeated in a great battle at Sulaziir by the arch mage Mycontil and his troop of wizards.

Reinhar's son, Reinhar II, took command of the army and set out on a two month overland retreat.  He arrived home with a thousand surviving fighting men and no shaman.  Reinhar II proved to be as good a ruler in defeat as his father was in war.  He consolidated his forces and pulled home almost all of his troops, as he knew that the defeat made them tempting prey for raiders and encroaching monsters.  This action allowed for the safe development of his peoples.

By the time the ninth Reinhar was king in 802 DR, the Arkaiuns were fat and lazy.  Reinhar IX, or Reinhar the Foolish as he is more commonly known, insisted on expanding his nation to gain more gold to finance his military campaigns.  He ordered the mining of many rich lodes of silver and electrum in the Gnollwatch mountains, but before his plans of expansion could begin, the miners encountered the drow of T'lindher.  The drow were outraged and began a steady series of raids and attacks on the Arkaiun strongholds.  Whole villages were destroyed overnight, and no trace of the invaders could be found.

Reinhar IX committed the foolhardy action of attacking the drow in retaliation.  While the Arkaiuns managed to get a force into the drow city, this action only succeeded in uniting the normally chaotic drow.  For once, the full power of a drow city was turned against an enemy.

The battle quickly moved back to the surface.  Reinhar's raiders were wiped out, leaving Reinhar with only a small portion of his original military.  This was not enough for the drow, who demanded total enslavement of the entire surface nation.  The Arkaiuns resisted valiantly, and the war went on for three decades at tremendous cost in life to both sides.

Finally, the drow had the Arkaiun forces cornered at Malduir.  Almost without hope, the defenders were overjoyed when a group of half-elven pilgrims appeared on the scene.  The high priestess, Cathtyr Shintar, offered the aid of her clerics to help defend the city, and Reinhar took this to be an omen from the gods.  A priestess was placed with almost every company.

Within a tenday the drow struck.  The priestesses did indeed prove to be of great aid, but to the drow.  Every priestess turned on the Arkaiuns, and Cathtyr herself slew Reinhar.  The drow were still weakened by the battle, and only the presence of the priestesses enabled them to win.  Cathtyr, realizing the unique advantage she possessed, made a deal that ever the suspicious drow embraced.  Her priestesses would rule the land, and in exchange they would provide access to the surface for the drow, trading weapons, slaves, and supplies.

The drow were delighted with this brazen offer from a surface dweller.   Reinhar had been slain and the insult avenged, and after 30 years of war the drow were not particularly interested in Dambrath.  They did insist, however, on taking the best captured males as slaves.  Cathtyr quickly agreed to this, seeing the males as an obstacle to her own power.

Cathtyr ruled for 205 years.  She fulfilled her promise to make Dambrath, or " The Nation of Pain," a bastion of evil in the Realms.  In her time, Cathtyr saw the priesthood of Loviatar expand to thousands, and faith in the Beastlords previously worshiped by the Arkaiuns was nearly eradicated.  Many of the Arkaiuns were able to escape their new mistresses, and flee to the Swagdar.  There they resumed their almost forgotten nomadic life.

The priestesses of Loviatar continued to enjoy good relations with the drow, and some even took mates, creating a race of drow half-elves.  These dark half-elves became known as the Crintri, or "noble ones."  Most are priestesses of Loviatar, though many are mages as well.  They consolidated their power, learning much of the area from the Shebali, or "lower ones," as the Arkaiuns are now called.  The capital of Dambrath was established at Cathtyr, built after Cathtyr's passing and named in her honor.  Her death came at the hands of her daughter, Filina, who had grown tired of waiting for her mother to die.  Filina ruled for only five years, however, before her own daughter, Cathakay, assumed the throne in the same fashion.  Cathakay ruled for 54 years, eventually falling in battle against a gold dragon.  She died childless, and here niece Melanith assumed the throne.

Melanith faced an increasing population, and unrest among males who longed for a return to their prestige of old.  Melanith did not return their previous status, but she did make use of them.  Fearing that the great nations of Mulhorand and Unther might rise again, she decided that mundane tasks, such as defense of the kingdom, would be handled by men.  She was the first to name a male to the post of warchief.  Sadalar, a Crintri, became the queen's consort.  His term as warchief was characterized by widespread bribery and corruption.  He was, however, responsible for getting many privileges returned to the Arkaiuns.  After Melanith's rule, the Shebali were considered second class citizens, rather than slaves.

Though males were granted more power during her rule, Melanith also solidified the split bewteen the sexes.  While the rulers of Dambarth had been females for over two centuries, it was more because of competence than gender.  Melanith, however, decreed that men could have no authority except over other men.  The female-led hierarchy of Loviatar was quick to back this move.

Many of the bravest and best men of the kingdom perished in raids on Estagund, Durpar, the bandit tribes of Veldorn, and against the gnolls that had returned to the Gnollwatch mountains.  Some even fought at the side of the drow in their battle with the svirfneblin city of Aventine.  The deep gnomes were destroyed, but so were the Shebali.  The drow and the Crintri were largely unharmed, and for their aid, the Crintri were rewarded with a number of drow males to breed in to their race.  Melanith took a drow male as her consort to replace Sadalar, who had perished in the conflict.  The drow, Nym Inthigg, fathered three daughters and a son.  It was at this time that Melantih began the isolationist policy that Dambrath still follows today.

Melanith ruled for 156 years; her daughter Ausitil for 125.  The current queen of Dambrath Yenandra, who is known in Dambarth as the "Pirate Queen," is said to have sailed as far south as Zakhara on pillaging raids.  Yenandra has been ruling for 71 years, and is beginning to show signs of age.  She has three daughters as well, named Luatharyn, Meltruil, and Hasafir.  While she does remain extremely popular, especially to the Crintri, the children of leaders in this land are not known to patiently wait their turn.~
@7307  = ~History of Luiren, Land of the Halflings: 

The halflings of Luiren claim that it is the original homeland of halflings in the Realms.  Although other halflings may disagree with this, it is true that Luiren was settled hundreds, perhaps thousands, of years ago.  

Luiren's history is one of conquerors and subjugation.  Throughout the centuries the halflings have been conquered by the barbarians who used to inhabit Dambrath, by the kingdom of Estagund, and even once by the monsters of Beldorn.  In every case, the invaders were eventually defeated because they made the mistake of underestimating the halflings due to their small stature.  A good bit of mischief, mayhem, and general trouble-making by the halflings also helped end the occupations.

Currently, Luiren is enjoying unprecedented prosperity.  The halflings are currently taking advantage of their relationship with the nation of Durpar; their biggest customer, and their biggest competitor.  Also, through these close ties with Durpar, Luiren has protected itself against another Dambraii invasion.  The rulers of Dambrath must know that if they begin to expand to the east, they will arouse the ire of Durpar, as well as Var and Esagund.  The threat of a trade embargo and/or military consequences have kept this aggressive nation away from the Luireners.  
~
@7308  = ~History of Halruaa:

Halruaa was settled centuries ago by wizards fleeing the Phaerimm in what was to become the Anauroch desert.  The first wizards came in unique flying ships invented by the Netheril, and found a beautiful and rich country settled only by shepherds and large herds of aurochs and wild rothe.  It was here that the wizards decided to make a stand, should the Phaerimm follow.  The Phaerimm never did, but Halruaa has had to defend itself from attacks by all of its neighbors since then.

Over the centuries Dambrath has attacked and raided Halruaa's ports and borders multiple times.  Once, led by a magic resistant barbarian, the Dambraii occupied all of the country south of Lake Halruaa.  They were defeated in battle by the great archmage Mycontil, who slew their barbarian leader.  Forty-thousand Dambraii attacked, and were stopped by 500 Halruaans.  More than 200 Halruaan wizards, including Mycontil, died in the battle.

The last attack upon Halruaa was less than 100 years ago, through the Telath Pass by the power hungry king of Lapaliiya.  He had allied with bandits from the wastes, though this time the Halruaans were able to field a larger force, including fighting men as well as wizards in their skyships.  The attackers were easily routed.

Halruaa also suffered through a civil war about five centuries ago, when a number of mages advocated beginning new experiments in magic, ones which even the Netherese didn't approve of.  The renegades were driven from the region, but went on to found the land of Thay, or so it is said in Halruaa.

Since then, Halruaa has been at peace (they have had no declared wars), though it still suffers raids from Dambraii pirates, bandits of the wastes, savages from the Mhair Jungles, and any other pirate, raider, or hungry wizard who thinks that magic and wealth grow on trees in Halruaa.

This constant raiding has made the Halruaans very defensive, warlike and traditional.  The people say that since wizards have always led them, wizards always will.~
@7309  = ~History of the North - Recent History of the North:  

In the waning summer months of 1367, an immense orc horde descended from the Spine of the World, intent on winding its way south into the trade lands of the North. This force of orcs, led by King Greneire, surged its way south between the Moonwood and the Cold Wood, stopping just outside the Citadel of Many Arrows. 

King Obould, orc ruler of the Citadel of Many Arrows, was terrified at the prospect of another orc horde, despite the fact that he knew they should be working together against the humans of the North and the spawn of Hellgate Keep. His tribal shamans, however, had been predicting a treacherous fall of the citadel - and they'd told the king that he'd be disposed by other orcs. 

Thus, it was a dark day when King Greneire and his horde of 150,000 orcs appeared on the plains outside the Citadel of Many Arrows. King Obould announced to his followers that this horde had been sent to dislodge them from their home and send them out to be scavengers among the plains. He vowed that, as Gruumsh as his witness, the Citadel of Many Arrows would slaughter these treacherous orcs "like elves during a festival." 

For four months, the 40,000 orcs within the citadel held their ground. Assault after assault was mounted against the high walls of the garrison, but the attacking orcs were losing far more than the defenders. Still, the living conditions within the walls - never too good to begin with - created losses of their own. 

The battle for the Citadel of Many Arrows culminated during the first week of Uktar. As another light blanket of snow sought to bury the gathered orcs, King Greneire threw his entire remaining army at the citadel, bursting its gates and pitting orc against orc in a flurry of swords. As the two orc kings sought one another out along the ramparts, the citadel began to burn. 

The orcs that survive the battle still speak of the superhuman prowess of the two kings as they battled one another before their troops. Finally, however, King Obould ran Greneire through with his long sword, but Obould was severely wounded by the time Greneire had breathed his last breath. The orcs erupted into battle once again, and no one is quite certain what became of King Obould. 

It was through the smoke and snow that the victors of the conflict emerged: the dwarves of Clan Warcrown along with a contingent of troops from Silverymoon. Charging in through the shattered gates, these new attackers quickly routed the exhausted orcs of the citadel, sending them scurrying off into the wilderness. 

King Emerus Warcrown now rules the Citadel of Many Arrows, though the dwarves now call the city by its old name of Felbarr. Most in the North still tend to refer to the city as the Citadel, however, waiting to see if it can withstand the next orc horde. King Warcrown has put out a call for all dwarves to help defend the citadel, and news of a new vein of gold and silver is spreading rapidly through dwarven communities.

@7310  = ~History of the North -  The Elven Exodus:  

This era left behind elven strongholds ripe for pillaging by humans and orcs. When elves chose to leave the North and travel to Evermeet, their works quickly disappeared, leaving only places like the Old Road and a ruined port in the High Forest to mark Eaerlann's passing. And yet it was not only the elves who would disappear from their long-held homes, The human nation of Netheril also stood on the brink of history. 

Doom for Netheril came in the form of a desert, devouring the Narrow Sea and spreading to fill its banks with dry dust and blowing sand. Legend states when the great wizards of Netheril realized their land was lost, they abandoned it and their countrymen, fleeing to all corners of the world and taking the secrets of wizardry with them. More likely, this was a slow migration that began 3,000 years ago and reached its conclusion 1,500 years later. 

Whatever the truth, wizards no longer dwelled in Netheril. To the north, the once-majestic dwarven stronghold of Delzoun fell upon hard days. Then the orcs struck. Orcs have always been foes in the North, surging out of their holes every few tens of generations when their normal haunts can no longer support their burgeoning numbers. This time they charged out of their caverns in the Spine of the World, poured out of abandoned mines in the Graypeaks, screamed out of lost dwarfholds in the Ice Mountains, raged forth from crypt complexes in the Nether Mountains, and stormed upward from the bowels of the High Moon Mountains. Never before or since has there been such an outpouring of orcs. Delzoun crumbled before this onslaught and was driven in on itself. Netheril, without its wizards, was wiped from the face of history. The Eaerlann elves alone withstood the onslaught, and with the aid of the treants of Turlang and other unnamed allies, were able to stave off the final days of their land for yet a few centuries more. 

In the east, Eaerlann built the fortress of Ascalhorn and turned it over to refugees from Netheril as Netherese followers built the town of Karse in the High Forest. The fleeing Netherese founded Llorkh and Loudwater. Others wandered the mountains, hills, and moors north and west of the High Forest, becoming ancestors of the Uthgardt and founders of Silverymoon, Everlund, and Sundabar. 
~
@7311  = ~History of the North - The Spread of Humankind:

The adaptable humans made use of magic they could seize or learn from the Proud Peoples to defeat all enemies, breaking (for a time) the power of giants and orcs. Waterdeep was founded. The last of the pure blood elves died out, a result of continued marriages with humans.

In the far west, men also dwelled - wise, clever primitives called the Ice Hunters. They lived simple lives on the coast since time beyond reckoning, countless generations before Netheril's first founders set foot on the Narrow Sea's western shore. Yet this peaceful folk fell prey to another invasion from the south: crude longships that carried a tall, fair-haired, warlike race who displaced the Ice Hunters from their ancestral lands.

This race, known as the Northmen, spread farms and villages along the coast from the banks of the Winding Water to the gorges of the Mirar. Northmen warriors drove the simple Ice Hunters farther and farther north, forced the goblinoids back into their mountain haunts, and instigated the last Council of Illefarn. Within 500 years of the Northmen's arrival, Illefarn was no more - its residents had migrated to Evermeet.

From the Coast, Northmen sailed westward, claiming and establishing colonies on the major western islands of Ruathym and Gundarlun, eventually spreading to all the islands in the northern sea. Others migrated northward, past the Spine of the World, and became the truly savage barbarians of Icewind Dale.

In the centuries that followed, Ascalhom became Hellgate Keep when it fell into the hands of fiends, and Eaerlann collapsed under the attack of a new orc horde. The elves fled southeast, joining with Northmen, Netherese descendants, and dwarves to form what would later be known as the Fallen Kingdom. This realm was short-lived and collapsed under the next orcish invasion - though in dying, it dealt the goblin races a blow from which they have yet to recover.~
@7312  = ~History of the North - The Might of Men:

Along the coast, in what was once the elven community of Illefarn, humanity was once again rising in power. Merchants from the south, tribesmen from the North, and seafarers from western islands had created a village around a trading post on a deep-water harbor, first known as Nimoar's Hold after the Uthgardt chieftain whose tribe seized and fortified the ramshackle village. Nimoar and his successors, known as War Lords, led the men of Waterdeep (as it had become known to ship captains) in a slowly losing battle against the trolls. In a final, climactic battle, the trolls breached the aging palisade and all seemed lost - until the magic of Ahghairon of Silverymoon turned luck against the trolls, destroying and scattering them.

Ahghairon, heir to the heritage and learning of Netheril, stayed in Waterdeep, and in his 112th year he again saved the city - this time from itself. In so doing, he created the Lords of Waterdeep. The city grew into the greatest in the North, possibly in all Faerun, With Waterdeep as a firm anchor, civilization forged cautiously into the wilderness. Illuskan (now Luskan) was taken from the orcs. Loudwater, Llorkh, Triboar, Longsaddle, Secomber, and other towns were settled by pioneers from Waterdeep, sponsored by Waterdhavian merchant families.

Though it's been centuries since the last orc invasion, 'there's still constant strife. Barbarians harass merchants, travelers, and towns; the seas swim with Northmen pirates; and wars have marred the land in recent years. Luskan, now a fierce merchant city known to harbor - and support - pirates, waged a war with the island realm of Ruathym over an act of piracy against one of the few legitimate Luskan merchant ships. The war raged for nearly a year, with Ruathym slowly losing ground. When it appeared Luskan would finally win the naval war and land on the island itself, the Lords' Alliance entered the fray. They threatened war against Luskan if the skirmishes didn't stop immediately. Unable to fight a two-front war efficiently, Luskan canceled its invasion plans.

Tensions between Luskan and Ruathym are still high, and their ships are often seen taking potshots at each other as they pass, often just a wave or two away from each other. The government of Ruathym has recently been sending adventurers into the hills of its island realm, looking for mercenaries who are killing merchants, farmers, and woodsmen. Ruathym believes Luskan still has a presence on the island, trying to win through subversion and terrorism what it could not accomplish through war.

To the far north, the Ten-Towns have finished rebuilding after being nearly destroyed by the monstrous forces of Akar Kessel. With help from the tundra barbarians living nearby, they've built and repaired their cities, replanted the sparse foliage, and - most importantly - replenished the morale of their citizens. A recent trader who passed through the area carrying 17 wagons of rare oak lumber said that it was nearly impossible to determine who's a barbarian and who isn't. "They're living together!" he reported in amazement.~
@7313  = ~History of the North - 1368, Year of the Banner:  

 As the dwarves settled in for the winter in their reclaimed city of Felbarr, a group of Zhentarim-sponsored adventurers broke into Great Worm Cavern, slaying Elrem the Wise, shaman leader of the Great Worm tribe, as the tribe's warriors descended into the ranks of the evil adventurers, teleportation magic spirited at least three of those responsible - as well as a vast amount of treasure stolen from Elrem - to safety. 

According to Themrin, the tribe's present shaman, Elrem promised to "watch over the tribe in spirit now that my mortal form is destroyed." Despite the reassuring words of Elrem, the tribe suffered through an oppressive winter that included both heavy snow, scarce game, and low morale. 

Trusted visitors to the barbarian encampment report that Themrin and Gweshen "Ironhand" Talistars are wearing some form of armor made from the scales of Elrem. This use of their former shaman's body as "protection" was supposedly ordained through a dream vision. The armor appears as little more than a supple leather armor, but seems to deflect blows and protect as well as full plate mail. 

Nesme reported a drastic rise in the number of troll attacks in the Evermoors, and various sources confirm that something is driving the trolls out of the moors. Whatever is behind the trolls' exodus is destined to remain a mystery for the remainder of the year, as adventuring parties expend themselves against the never-ending supply of trolls that are fleeing the bog. 

In the most surprising move of the year, the Blue Bear Tribe, led by the shaman/chieftain Tanta Hagara, marched on the fiend-ridden fortress of Hellgate Keep. While a brief struggle for political 'control of the city was reported by various sources, Tanta Hagara emerged as the new ruler of the city. 
~
@7314  = ~History of the North - 1369, Year of the Gauntlet:

The tumultuous climate of Hellgate Keep continued to provide adventuring activity. A group of Harpers infiltrated the city using cloaking magic and revealed that Tanta Hagara was actually an annis. This revelation did nothing to hamper the Blue Bear's respect for their powerful chieftain however, and 'the city responded to the unmasking by attacking caravans en route to Sundabar. In addition, a few expeditionary forces of tanar'ri were sent to harass the Citadel of the Mists, Sundabar, and Silverymoon. Tanta Hagara informed her "loyal troops" that gates existed in these cities that could allow other tanar'ri to "join us in the glorious battles to come as we take control of all of the North!"

Alustriel cast powerful magical spells in the defense of Silverymoon against the raiding tanar'ri, and the city itself suffered no damage from their attack. The Mistmaster of the Citadel of the Mists likewise aided in the defense of his citadel, though reports still rage about the assistance of the treants of the High Forest.

Sundabar suffered from Hellgate Keep's attack, as the fiends broke through the walls and raised havoc along the city streets. While adventurers battled the fiends, Helm Dwarffriend led a large contingent of the city guard to drive the remainder from Sundabar. Still, the fiends from Hellgate Keep left the city with 'the satisfaction of knowing that it was burning in their wake. Within two days, however, the fires were extinguished, and Sundabar has since rebuilt from the attack.

By mid Eleasias, rumors that Turlang, the powerful treant who resides in the northern High Forest, was actively defending the woodlands near the Citadel of the Mists reached the ears of Tanta Hagara, the hag-ruler of Hellgate Keep. News that Turlang was aiding the Mistmaster did not escape her notice, and the belief that the Citadel of the Mists was holding an extra-planar artifact only added to the hag's interest.

Tanta assembled a large force consisting of more than 100 tanar'ri and other fiends as well as 500 members of the Blue Bear tribe to raze the Citadel of the Mists. But as the evil forces marched their way into the High Forest, the Mistmaster put his own plan into motion. Two Harper agents, a bard named Cryshana Fireglen and a priest of Mystra known as Spellviper, infiltrated Hellgate Keep disguised as members of the Blue Bear tribe. Each carried with them part of an extra-planar artifact called the Gatekeeper's Crystal.

The Gatekeeper's Crystal is an artifact shaped like a three-pointed star that is made of onyx and an unknown metal that entwines itself through the gem. Each point of the star is a separate piece that can be combined together to create the artifact or separated to form three powerful magical items. While the crystal can be used in different manners, it was primarily created to bring down wards, including mythals and other powerful protections. According to legend, it was created by a powerful lich who used it to render clerics powerless, stripping them of their ability to turn undead and nullifying necromantic magic within a 50-mile radius.

The Mistmaster had a different use for the Gatekeeper's Crystal, but he needed volunteers to aid him in placing two shards of the crystal at precise locations within the warded city of Hellgate Keep. In particular, he needed two people who would be willing to trade their lives to exterminate the fiends of Hellgate Keep forever. Spellviper and Cryshana agreed to the suicide mission, Holding the pieces of the crystal, the two Harpers waited for the Mistmaster to activate the magic with his third piece, initiating the magic that would tear Hellgate Keep asunder. When a blazing beam of purple energy illuminated the skies over the keep, no one within the fiend's stronghold had time to wonder what was happening.

The power of the Gatekeeper's Crystal forced the wards to cascade upon the city, causing an implosion that shook the ground for more than 100 miles. As quickly as the wards surrounding Hellgate Keep collapsed, the crystal released the magical energy in an explosion that leveled every building in the city, leaving nothing but fist-sized chunks of rocks where Hellgate Keep once stood. Not a living creature stirred in the remains; all was silent and lifeless.

The force of tanar'ri from Hellgate Keep was unsure what had happened but had felt the tremor when the Gatekeeper's Crystal had been activated. They were fighting for their own lives, however, as the treants, korred, centaurs, satyrs, dryads, and other creatures of the High Forest - including defenders of the Citadel of the Mists - battered them into the moist earth. One of the North's most notable rulers fell in the battle, however, but he took at least six tanar'ri with him to his grave. Faurael Blackhammer, the lord protector of Triboar, fell along- side his troops near the conclusion of the conflict.

Within weeks after the final battle with Hellgate Keep, treants blocked passage farther north at the joining of the Heart-blood and Delimbiyr rivers. While the treants care little for hunters and adventurers passing through the area, all caravans seeking passage north to Sundabar have been repulsed - and this is not a matter that the treants wish to negotiate.

In another mishap blamed on Turlang, Tumstone Pass was blocked by a tremendous avalanche. This final calamity sealed the Upvale from any major force of men. Travel into the area formerly occupied by Hellgate Keep is now limited to adventurers and other brave travelers.

The Mistmaster has been questioned repeatedly by some of the most powerful wizards in the Realms, including Elminster of Shadowdale and Khelben Arunsun, about the current location of the Gatekeeper's Crystal. Most sources claim that the pieces of the crystal have been scattered amongst the planes again, but no one is certain.

Near Nesme, the source of the trolls' exodus is revealed. Fog and cloud giants have taken up residence in the moor, driving the trolls from the giants' new "homeland." While its unknown how many giants have taken up residence in the High Moor, estimates range up to several hundred. A thick mist continually hangs in the air of the Evermoors now, even more persistent and thick than the mist before the giants' arrival. Many believe that these new mists are the work of the cloud giants, but none can be certain.

Alustriel of Silverymoon sent a detachment of guards to investigate the eastern borders of the moor, and the guards returned with news that a gathering of around 20 fog giants who were "of good nature and quite friendly" had taken up residence in a formerly troll-infested area.

Guards from neighboring Nesme were not so fortunate, however, running into a clan of violent, boulder-hurling fog and cloud giants who nearly decimated their unit. In addition, a group of adventurers crawled into Nesme with terrible burns, reporting that they had run into a black dragon at a fog giant encampment. Overall, it appears that both good and evil giants now call the moor their home. ''~
@7315  = ~History of the North - Return of the Beast (1367 - ?):  

Sages, philosophers, historians, and priests alike feel an ill-boding in the chill air. They predict a slow change over the next decade, but within the lifetime of men born on the first day of this age. They believe that the beasts that once ruled the land plan to return to claim what's rightfully theirs, imprisoning and enslaving the crowns. Where elves once reigned, men now rule, but their hold - as true for all civilizations before - is tenuous at best. 
~
@7316  = ~History of the North - 137O, Year of the Tankard:  

Even before spring has graced the Savage North, reports of treants massing in the High Forest have reached all of the northern cities. It seems that all of the creatures of the forest have mobilized to restore the High Forest after the fall of Hellgate Keep. Something must still reside below the ruins of Hellgate Keep, however, for the Company of the Jaded Heart never emerged from the depths below the city. The treants have since blocked entrance into the ruins, sealing whatever evil still lurks within far below the sight of man. 

But there is other activity in the North as well. Luskan still flirts with war, tempting neighboring cities and yet staying just below the wrath of Waterdeep. The barbarians still brew in the north, easy to take offense at innocent incursions into their sacred holdings. Rumors of Zhentarim agents scouring the Fallen Lands for powerful magic from long-lost Netheril continue to circulate. And adventurers still abound in the Savage Frontier.
~
@7317  = ~History of Waterdeep:  

Waterdeep was used as a trading site for trade activities between northern tribesmen and southern merchants more than two millennia ago. By 1,000 years ago, permanent farms had sprung up in the area. The first mention of a Waterdeep (not as a city, but as a collection of warlords) occurs only 400 years ago. The city was truly established as a going concern by 1032 DR, the year Ahghairon became the first Lord of Waterdeep, and the date from which Northreckoning is counted. The city grew spectacularly, such that by 1248 DR both the City of the Dead and the guilds had been developed. The guildmasters seized control soon afterwards, ushering in a period of unrest and bitter conflict known as the Guildwars. The Guildwars ended only when the two surviving guildmasters brought in their own period of misrule. It was only in 1273 DR that the present system of government (or lack thereof was instituted. This was the year that the Magisters were established and the secret Lords of Waterdeep were firmly reestablished. Since that time, the city has continued to grow and prosper. Humankind and other races come from all over the Realms to earn hard coin in the City of Splendors. Over the years these successful merchants have set up guilds and themselves become nobility, supporting the secretive Lords of Waterdeep who police the city fairly, yet with a light hand, by means of the superb city guard (soldiers), city watch (police), and over 20 black-robed magistrates. As a result, Waterdeep is a place tolerant of different races, religions, and lifestyles. This in turn has encouraged commerce, and Waterdeep has grown into a huge, eclectic city.

@7318  = ~History of the Dales and the Elven Court:

The founding of the Dalelands long preceded the creation of any of the existing Dales by hundreds of years, and the year numbering system known as Dalereckoning is actually a commemoration of humankind being given permission to settle in the lands north and west of the Inner Sea.  Most of the current Dales are relative newcomers, the older having been abandoned, destroyed, or overrun long ago.  In those ancient days, when Suzail and Chondathan (now called Saerloon) were mere coastal trading posts, the elves who ruled this forest entertained a request from settlers from the East; refugees and farmers from far-off Impiltur and Damara.  This request was to farm and settle the borders of the great forest Cormanthor, in particular the rich delves and dales along the rivers Arkhen and Ashaba.  These newcomers did not wish to lumber or clear the inhabited forest, but only to settle on the rich territories on its edges, and unlike some other settlers (early Sembia comes to mind) were willing to ask permission.

The lords of the Elven Court granted that request in return for aid from these new Dalelanders against outside aggression, both monstrous (orcs and goblins from the lands of Thar) and human (the rising powers in Cormyr and Sembia).  In commemoration of this pact, humans and elves raised the Standing Stone that is now seen where the Moonsea Ride reaches Rauthauvyr's Road, the road from Essembra to Hillsfar.  It is from the date of the raising of this stone that Dalereckoning is counted.  According to the pact made, the Dalesmen would only settle those regions that were unforested or unclaimed by the elves.  As the elven woods receded under the axes of further invaders and settlers, old Dales perished and new ones came into being along the borders of the woods.  People, both good and bad, have raised petty nations in the Dalelands since, though any one Dale that turned against the pact would have to deal with the others.  Each of the Dales is a large swath of farms and fields, with a few scattered settlements and usually one central marketplace, capital, or Dale center.  These centers are often, but not always, named after the Dales they are in, adding to the confusion as to what is a Dalelands territory.

The Dales are not city-states, for their largest groupings of population rate as towns at best, and they lack the defensive walls common throughout the Heartlands.  They are neither true nations in the fashion of Cormyr or Sembia, and occupy a gray middle ground wherein they are nothing more, or less, than Dales.

Each Dale has slightly different laws, customs, and military organizations.  Many rely on the work of charismatic heroes and adventuring companies for aid in times of trouble, and a large number of these individuals use the region as a base.  This attraction for adventurers is further increased by the large number of elven and pre-elven ruins in the area and the departure of the Elven Court for Evermeet, leaving the woods open for exploration and exploitation.

The history of the Dales is filled with battles and attacks on its various members.  In the Year of the Worm (1356 DR), Scardale, under the command of Lashan Aumersair, launched a number of swift attacks, conquering a number of the surrounding Dales.  A coalition of forces from the others, as well as Sembia, Cormyr, and Zhentil Keep crushed the invaders and occupied Scardale.  During the Time of Troubles (1358 DR/0 PR), Shadowdale was attacked by Zhentil Keep.  More recently, the Dalelands have committed forces to a unified army under King Azoun IV of Cormyr to turn back the Tuigan Invasion (1360 DR).~
@7319  = ~History of Cormyr:  

Cormyr dates its years from the founding of House Obarskyr 1,342 years ago, the first of the noble houses and the line of its kings.  For the bulk of this time, Cormyr was little more than a single city (Suzail) and a few fortified outposts.  At times the monarch was forced by rebellion and intrigue to rule from those outposts instead of from the throne.  King Azoun is the fourth of his name and the 71st of his line. 

The land has been officially at peace for many years - since Rhigaerd overthrew the last of the border raiders.  However, Cormyrean armies have taken part in many actions in nearby regions, recently mustering its forces to face Gondegal, the rebel of Arabel; to occupy Tilverton on the marches of the Dalelands; and to lead a crusade against the great Tuigan horde invading from the east.  One wit has noted that "Yes, the land is at peace, but the army has to keep busy."  In addition to pursuing major actions, Cormyrean patrols often skirmish with bandits on the roads in the north and west, and are at present battling orcs and other creatures north and east of Cormyr in Tilver's Gap and Shadow Gap.  Both of these areas are threatened by raiders who will menace Cormyr itself if they ever overrun Tilverton.  Cormyr has built a fortress, Castle Crag, to defend the kingdom from attacks from that quarter, and maintains the High Horn to protect against attacks from the West. '
~
@7320  = ~History of Sembia:

The land of Sembia was settled by humans coming to the Sea of Fallen Stars from the south, and was originally chosen for its stands of huge, high-quality iliyr-wood timber so prized in shipbuilding.  However, as the forests were cleared over the years, the treecutters came into increasing conflict with elves who feared the loss of their entire wood.  This would undoubtedly have occurred, had not the hastily gathered mercenary troops of the fledgling land been defeated by the elves at Singing Arrows (884 DR).  This battle convinced distant Chondath to abandon its holdings in the region and allow the immigrant Sembians to establish their independence (though as little more than a collection of rival city-states, much like the Moonsea or Vast of today).  It also set the stage for the appearance of the Raven.

The young country grew strong as farms prospered in the newly cleared lands.  Craftsmen arrived from the south to take advantage of this chance to acquire land and wealth, bringing their trades with them.  Rauthauvyr the Raven unified the city-states and towns in the face of the continuing "elven menace," and insisted on maintaining a standing army, which he kept in practice by policing Sembia's borders and improving its roads.  At this time (913 DR), Sembia became as a true nation.

The Moonsea's (Dragon Sea's) mineral wealth was discovered by humankind at about this time, and pressure began to grow for a trade road through the elven woods to make Sembia the world's gateway to all these riches.  The Raven went alone as an envoy to the Elven Court and asked the elders of their Council to approve a road open to humans linking Sembia to the shores of the Dragon Sea (an earlier road had been destroyed during the conflict and was now overgrown).  Raven proposed that the elves choose the route and retain control of it and the woods around it, so that no woodcutting or human settlement would occur.  The elves had earlier made similar arrangements with the Dalesmen and had no difficulty with the concept of such an agreement.  However, the inhabitants of Velarsdale (now Harrowdale) refused the proposal, not wanting or needing such a road at that time (curious, since later a ruler of Harrowdale commissioned the disastrous Halfaxe Trail). The elves, not wishing to offend long-time allies, refused Raven's request.

Rebuffed, the Raven then threatened to exterminate the isolated elves in Amothoi, the last embattled remnant of the elves in Sembia, if the Elven Court did not cooperate.  If the road was built, however, they would be free to trade, or not trade, as they wished.  The elves agreed under this pressure, and Sembia's financial future was secured. Hillsfar, on the shores of the Dragon Sea, became a commercial meeting ground between humankind and elves, as did Elventree.  The route the elves chose ran past the base of the Standing Stone as a reminder of earlier, less-hostile dealings between humans and elves.  Over the years the elves of Amothoi came north to join their brethren or slipped away to seek Evermeet, leaving their wood to gradually disappear.

Sembia grew rich under merchant leaders of increasing wisdom, such as Saer (for whom Saerb was named) and Selgar (for whom Chancelgaunt was renamed as Selgaunt).  Before his death, Rauthauvyr the Raven saw that these merchants had a strong standing council of merchant elders to advise them and to ensure that no ruler could hold onto power by force of arms.  Then this farsighted man, creator of a nation, now half-blind and infirm from old war wounds, rode north into the elven woods and disappeared.  None know what happened to him or where his bones lie, save perhaps some few elder elves.~
@7321  = ~History of the Moonsea:  

The Moonsea has a long history as the border between the elven lands to the south and the darker, more sinister lands of the Ride and Thar, home of dragons and giant and ogre tribes in great multitudes.  The deep sea was an excellent barrier to the raiders, as those tribes who sought invasion had to detour around and through the lands that would eventually hold Yulash, Zhentil Keep, and Hillsfar. 

The first true settlement in Moonsea was Northkeep, a shining citadel established as a beacon of civilization and a jumping-off point for merchants seeking trade with the dwarves of the North - including not only Tethyamar, but the clans of the Cold Lands - who traded their metalwork and craft for much-needed magic.  In the end, Northkeep was sunk beneath the icy waters of the Moonsea by the inhuman forces, and humankind suffered one of many setbacks in the region. 

So has been the nature of human habitation of this region since the beginning.  Human settlements thrive for a few years, usually through sheer willpower and on the strength of a sharp sword, and then are overrun by goblins, orcs, dragons, beholders, or giants.  Phlan has fallen and risen again.  Yulash is a ruin where a decade ago there was a thriving town.  Hulburg and Sulasspryn are empty hulks.  Each of the cities of the Moonsea seems threatened with extinction in its turn, then is rebuilt. 

This cycle may be the reason that only the strongest and the most savage survive, even prosper, in the lands of the Moonsea.  The greatest cities - Hillsfar, Mulmaster, and the impenetrable Zhentil Keep - are all ruled by evil people who control their lands with iron grips.  The lesser cities, Elventree, Phlan, and Thentia, may be less evil, but have a strong, independent, almost chaotic nature.  In many ways the Moonsea is a frontier, with a frontier mentality. 
~
@7322  = ~History of the Vast:  

Two millennia ago the Vast was Vastar, the orcish lands. These were the breeding grounds of the goblin hordes that would spill eastward and cross the Dragon Reach in ramshackle boats to raid the elves. The orcs were overthrown by invading dwarves, who established the Realm of the Glimmering Swords. It was during this time that the first humans came to the Vast, including the mage Maskyr. 

The rule of the dwarves occurred against a backdrop of constant war with the orcs, such that there were perhaps only 40 years of true peace for the Realm of the Glimmering Swords. The orcs overran the dwarves, and they escaped extinction only through the aid of human and elven allies. The remaining dwarves left the region to the newly arriving humans and retreated to the east, to the south, and to isolated and hidden communities within the Vast. 

The most successful of the humans were the adventurers whose hunger was sated by gold and whose thirst was slaked by great deeds. This was the Time of the Glorious Fools, and there are those who will argue that it is still that age, as adventurers still rule the cities of Calaunt and Ravens Bluff. The orcs today are contained, if not conquered, and trade has grown up in the lands of the Vast. However, for many individuals with adventuring blood, it is still a wilderness in which one may prove one's worth. 
~
@7323  = ~History of the Dragon Coast:  

The history of the Dragon Coast is the history of money, particularly the darker side of the coin.  Situated on the main trade routes between the Inner Sea and the Sword Coast, these lands never coalesced into a solid, coherent nation, like Cormyr or Sembia. Instead small petty city-states have risen and fallen, powered by greed and the most powerful merchant or pirate faction of the day. 

As a result, the Dragon Coast has always been the home of the smuggler, the pirate, the rogue, and the hired killer. It has been the place where those seeking to skirt the laws of more civilized nations to the north make landfall.  It is here that the Red Wizards gain their access to the Western Heartlands, and where the Cult of the Dragon launches its plots to the south.  And it is here that independent secret societies and assassin guilds have their greatest power. 

The last semblance of organized resistance to this trend was the reign of Verovan, last of the kings of Westgate.  The monarchy of Westgate had long worked closely with the various mercantile and pirate factions, but Verovan attempted to stem the growing power of the merchant houses and petty lords.  His sudden and mysterious death without acceptable heirs in 1248 DR opened the door for much of what now is commonplace in the Dragon Coast - corruption and treachery. 

It should be noted that while Verovan's name is still venerated in these lands, better known is Immurk, the greatest of the Inner Sea Pirates, a brash and flamboyant rogue who united a pirate fleet beneath him and ruled from 1164 DR to his death in 1201 DR.  Such it is in the Dragon Coast, that good people are venerated, but the power of darker rogues is imitated. 
~
@7324  = ~History of the Western Heartlands:

The history of the Western Heartlands is a history of endless battles and destroyed empires. In ancient times these were the lands of the Fallen Kingdom of Illefarn, the Lost Kingdom of Man, and rumored Netheril. In more recent history, the land has been fertilized with blood and bone as forces from the Empires of the Sands surged northward, the evil peoples within Dragonspear and the Goblin Marches spilled forth, and mercenary companies moved to and fro in the service of one petty warlord after another. Recent battles leveled the Way Inn and threatened Daggerford. Even the Time of Troubles did not leave this desolate land unmarked - Bhaal himself perished at Boareskyr Bridge, and the waters it passes over have remained poisoned to this day.

The cities of the Western Heartlands are strong, independent, and varied. They are also strongly motivated by trade, and listen harder to the ringing of gold than the call of battle. But something else prospers in the open land - freedom and opportunity. No nation lays claim on the Western Heartlands to land beyond that which their armies can control, and no warlord can make demands beyond the swing of his axe. Small holds and castles regularly spring up, only to be knocked down by invading forces, or abandoned after a generation or two. Lost dungeons and secret citadels lie scattered throughout the land, and this rugged frontier presents more than enough opportunities for adventurers.~
@7325  = ~History of the Zhentarim, Two Zhents' Worth:  

Much confusion exists in the Realms regarding Zhentil Keep and the (not-so) secret society known as the Black Network or Zhentarim.  The two are closely tied, such that a speaker may refer to one when meaning the other and still be clearly understood.  In general, both mean trouble.

Zhentil Keep is a walled independent city on the western shores of the Moonsea.  It is one of the most evil cities in the Realms, a blight on the North, and a haven for Evil groups, plotting manipulators, dark religions, and foul practices.  Its rulers seek to dominate the lands around it, including the Dragonspine Mountains, Yulash, Voonlar, and the neighboring Dales.  The city of Zhentil Keep and its armies (known as the Zhentilar, to make matters more confusing) have destroyed Teshendale, come close to destroying Daggerdale, and for a long time had an agent ruling Shadowdale.  

The Zhentarim is an organization of evil priests, wizards, and inhuman creatures bent on controlling all the trade and power between the Sword Coast (meaning Baldur's Gate and Waterdeep) and the Moonsea (including the intervening lands of Cormyr and Anauroch).  Its aims in the Moonsea area are the same as Zhentil Keep's, and the two factions work hand-in-glove, often sharing the same membership.  The Zhentarim have a more far-reaching effect than Zhentil Keep, though, and have agents throughout the North.

In addition, the Zhentarim are not limited to Zhentil Keep itself, and maintain a number of fortified outposts.  Their rulership has spread with the passing years.  In addition to being the dominant force in Zhentil Keep, the Zhentarim control the Citadel of the Raven and Darkhold, two important castle complexes.  Over the years, more power has been moving away from Zhentil Keep (filled with a lot of unknown and untrustworthy flunkies) and into these more secure areas.  

Within the Dalelands area, Zhentarim smells of Zhentil Keep and vice versa, but in reality not every Keeper (yet another name for a native of Zhentil Keep) is of the Black Network, and not every agent of the Zhentarim is from Zhentil Keep.  Adventurers should watch who they trust as a result.

@7326  = ~History of Ulgarth:   

Ulgarth was settled by the great empire of Raurin, in the height of its power.  When the empire was destroyed, it endured centuries of barbarism.  Warchiefs united the country several times during this period.  They fought many skirmishes with other barbarians, particularly those in Durpar and Var the Golden.  In 202 DR, the barbarian tribes were nearly wiped out by the forces of Mulhorand.

In 348 DR, a group of outlaws, fleeing the justice of the priest-kings of Mulhorand, came to Ulgarth.  There they found a fertile, almost unoccupied land.  They settled down, and began raising children and crops.  This new society in Ulgarth gradually grew in power, while its neighbors grew apace.  But while Durpar grew as a result of its commerce and its philosophy of balance, Ulgarth concentrated on agrarian pursuits.  The Ulgarthians developed a highly structured caste system of lords and peasants.  In 1002 DR, the centuries long skirmishes between Durpar and Ulgarth came to an end, as the two countries finally reached a balance of power.  There were too many centuries of warfare between the countries for them to completely trust each other.  With their mutual border well defended on both sides, both countries have given up on the idea of conquering the other.

Trade between the Ulgarth and the Shining Lands has become a vital factor to both nations.  Ulgarth produces many of the items that Durparians trade throughout the world.  In return, Durpar trades many exotic items to Ulgarth.  Of course, the Durparian merchants usually get the better of any trade.  The current king, Drasna the Fortunate, has continued on his predecessor's policy of non-aggression with the Durparians.

@7327  = ~History of the Drow, The Descent:  

We know very little of the Ilythiiri, or "Elves of the South," before this crucial event.  Even then they were known as "Dark Elves," for the hue of their skins.  They dwelt in the jungles and hot forests of the South.  A proud, warlike, culturally advanced (some sages of other elven peoples say "decadent") folk, the Ilythiiri attacked all neighbors, including other elven tribes.  Their cruel raids and depredations, ordered by warlike nobility and the clergy of their two cruel deities, Ghaunadaur and Lolth, forced elves, humans, dwarves, and others to ally against them. 

Defeated in a series of titanic magical battles, the dark elves fled into underground warrens they had earlier discovered.  This event, known as "the Descent," marked the end of the drow as a surface-dwelling race. 
~
@7328  = ~History of the Drow, The Dark Wars:   

The warlike drow nature did not change when they escaped their surface foes during The Descent.  In fact, they immediately launched a series of wars to establish territories in the Underdark.  They began by stealing and seizing dwarven magical items, and using them against the dwarves - establishing an enmity that is still strong today. 

The drow then fought among themselves, noble against noble, priest against priestess, for rule of their new realm.  This all-out war ended amid great magical explosions that brought down the roof of the largest dwarven cavern they had seized, great Bhaerynden.  The ceiling collapsed entirely, burying many drow and the shattered dwarven cities.  The cavern, now open to the sky, became known as The Great Rift.  The surviving drow nobles gathered what people, slaves, and equipment they could seize, and fled into the Underdark in search of places to dwell.  "The Scattering" brought about the many rival, self-interested cities where most drow live today.

@7329  = ~History of Waterdeep -  Age 0, Tuabemoots and Pioneers:  

Few now know the true history of this great city, which had its beginnings over a thousand years ago, when the North was truly what Southerners still sneeringly call it: "the Savage North." In those days, most of the North was covered with vast, tall forests of ancient green, and inhabited by dwarves and goblinkind (in the most northern mountains and foothills) and elves (in widely scattered forest enclaves everywhere else). A few primitive human tribes lived along the Sword Coast, fishing and hunting and gathering in spring and fall to trade their furs for the merchants' jewelry and metal tools, or the occasionally-available weapon or two, with vessels sailing in from the South. In the spring, these vessels came primarily to cut and take huge trees for shipbuilding, trees being no longer available in such large sizes farther south.

In the fall, the vessels came in to cut timber for their own repairs, or to take on a cargo of wood if the misfortunes of trading had left their holds low or empty. Most of these trademoots were at a certain place where there was a great natural deepwater harbor, protected from the sea by a rocky spur of land, an arm of an isolated coastal crag, and a rocky island beyond it. 
~
@7330  = ~History of Waterdeep -  Age I, The Rise of the Warlords:

Over the years, the forest was cut back farther and farther from the shore, and tribes began to stay most of the year there, farming the cleared land. The wiser among them claimed and controlled some of the timber in order to trade for more weaponry and tools. Such claims angered many who found the squatters rich from frequent trade, and brought attacks from land and sea, the more warlike tribes slaughtering the more sedentary settlers. Noted among these tribes was that led by Nimoar, a chieftain who ordered his people to seize the farms, crude wooden docks, trading sheds, and storage barns built up around the bay. They settled there themselves, and erected a log palisade within an earthen embankment to protect the holdings, After several abortive pirate and tribal raids, Nimoar's people thrived in their new home, a fledgling town referred to as "the town of Water-deep."

Farther north, orc tribes had outgrown their mountain strongholds. Attempts to expand underground met with fierce dwarven resistance (although many small gnomish colonies were overwhelmed and wiped out), and the orcs spread out on the surface of the land, coming south and down out of the mountains, hurling their seemingly endless numbers against all who stood in their path. Here and there elven enclaves held out, but the push southward displaced many other northern inhabitants, including the "everlasting ones" (trolls), who came down into the newly-cleared lands northeast of Nimoar's Hold, those lands now known as the Trollmoors.  Nimoar died of old age during this time of increasing danger. Younger War Lords led the men of Waterdeep (for so the ship-captains called the harbor) in battles against the trolls. There were many bloody struggles between men and trolls for a decade, until the magic of a Northern youth named Ahghairon turned the fortunes of war against the trolls, and the "everlasting ones" were destroyed or scattered. Ahghairon rose 'slowly in skill and power with the passage of years, until he became a great mage. He discovered a supply of potions of longevity (or learned the art of making such), for he lived on, still physically a man in his prime, for decade upon decade.

Fearing further attacks, the men of Waterdeep raised a small keep on the slopes of Mount Waterdeep above their farms, where fire arrows from on high could defend against attacking trolls. Many outlying tribes who had come to the settlement for safety from the trolls stayed, and expanded the walls with new farms several times. War Lords ruled the Free City of Waterdeep, holding it independent and increasingly wealthy as years passed. ~
@7331  = ~History of Waterdeep -  Age III, The Bloody Reign of the Guildmasters:

There was great turmoil in the City as the Guildmasters argued amongst themselves as to who should govern the City, and more than one merchant of power was found murdered. Groups of liveried bodyguards appeared openly armed on the streets, accompanying their masters, and two very troubled months passed as they bickered and parleyed (and occasionally dueled in the streets). At last, they decided that all Masters should rule Waterdeep together, in a council, The lesser nobles and many townsfolk protested, saying that the Lords ruled by right and by the peoples' consent, but the Guildmasters said that the Lords had not been seen since Ahghairon's death, and that they must always have been golems or zombies controlled by Ahghairon himself, to conceal his lone rule, and indeed, the Lords were silent and unseen, and continued to be so.

In truth, the Lords were real men and women whose identities had been compromised, over the years, by certain curious Guildmasters who had ordered them slain by their own closemouthed, loyal servants following Ahghairon's death. The only Lords still surviving (those who had remained secret) were Baeron, a woodworker, and Shilam, an apprentice wizard. These surviving Lords kept very quiet, and waited. The Guildmasters thought all the living Lords of the City had been eliminated, and took firm rule over Waterdeep.

The Guildmasters ruled Waterdeep for only six years ere their self-interested squabbling led to bloodshed. Open quarrels and a few murders quickly erupted into a brief but vicious series of street fights and midnight attacks. This strife, ofttimes termed "the Guildwars" by sages (although it was never as long-drawn-out or so formal as to be called a "war" when it was taking place), left all but two Guildmasters dead, most of the City's best minds stilled, and much of the City's gold wasted or plundered with the Guilds in disarray.

The surviving Guildmasters were Lhorar Gildeggh of the Shipwrights and Ehlemm Zoar of the Gemcutters. These two - ruthless manipulators both - were well-matched and could not overcome each other, though their private armies clashed often in the streets. At length, they sickened of bloodshed, after many from both families were dead in the gutters, and agreed to rule together. Two thrones were set up in Castle Waterdeep, and from then the two argued bitterly over this and that, and the City was a place of tension and fear. All matters, including the recognition of new Guildmasters to rule the "headless" guilds, had to come before the Two Lords Magister, as Lhorar and Ehlemm were called. Few matters were settled.~
@7332  = ~History of Waterdeep - Age II, The Lords' Rule Begins:  

In his 112th winter, Ahghairon had a sharp disagreement with Raurlor, who was then Warlord of Waterdeep. Raurlor wanted to use Waterdeep's acquired wealth and strength-of-arms to create a Northern empire, with Waterdeep its capital (and Raurlor its ruler), and gathered armies for the purpose. Ahghairon defied him before all the people, and Raurlor ordered the mage be chained. Ahghairon magically struck aside all who sought to lay hands on him. In a fury Raurlor struck at the mage with his own blade. Ahghairon rose into the air, just out of reach, and, as the infuriated Warlord slashed repeatedly at his rising feet, gestured. Raurlor's blade transmuted in his hand, from steel into a hissing serpent, which promptly bit him. The Warlord died of the venom before the shocked people assembled there. Ahghairon then gathered all the captains of Waterdeep's army, and all the seniors of the 'families of Waterdeep. While runners sought to bring them to the Castle, flames roared and crackled in the Warlord's empty chair-of-state at Ahghairon's bidding, so that no one sat there. Then at a gesture from the mage, the flames were gone as though they had never been, leaving the chair unmarked. Ahghairon seated himself, then, and proclaimed himself the first Lord of Waterdeep, saying that henceforth wisdom and not armed might would rule in the city. He would gather some few - in secret - to rule as Lords with him, masked and disguised when they appeared to the people, but equal to him in authority and free of coercion by any, himself included. These Lords were to be drawn from all walks of life in the city, and could serve as long as they wished. 

The people heard, and agreed, and for the next two hundred years, Ahghairon ruled Waterdeep with his unknown fellow Lords, Over the years, the masked Lords were a group of sometimes five, six, or seven, who appeared seldom and said little. Some whispered that they were Ahghairon's servants, or even magical automatons controlled by the Old Mage. Still, Ahghairon's justice was swift and fair, his laws good, his guardsmen polite and just as ready to help as apprehend, and the people approved. The years passed in peace and prosperity. The North was opened to humans. Roads built under Ahghairon's direction linked it together, from the ruins of "the Fallen Kingdom," which had been shattered by goblin races' attacks before men were numerous in the North, to the cities that would later become Amn. Waterdeep grew fivefold in size and wealth. From all over the Realms, folk began to come to the "Crown of the North," drawn by money - and among them came those who rob, cheat, and steal. When word of doings extending beyond simple theft to deception-in-workmanship and the appearance of many fly-by-night impostor craftsmen reached Ahghairon's ears, he called together the senior merchants, "the Noble Ones," and suggested that they form guilds as was done in the far South to police the unscrupulous of their own professions. Some resisted, or were furious, but most saw the advantages of such an arrangement, particularly if they were free to set matters up themselves, and not have less favorable arrangements forced upon them. The Guilds were created forthwith, Waterdeep continued to grow in size and prosperity, Twice more the city walls were expanded, and its merchants traveled the world over, bringing back exotic goods from afar, and spreading word of the city's wealth to remote lands. In the South, some listened with an eye to conquest or at least plunder, but swords were already out in those southern lands in a time of widespread strife, and no invaders came. 

Ahghairon's health eventually failed and he died. He was buried with ceremony in his tower, which was secured against thieves and fools. Those who learned the arts arcane from the Old Mage cast the most potent protective magics known upon his home and resting-place (which, many believe, remains inviolate today).

@7333  = ~History of Waterdeep - Age IV, The Return of the Lords:

One day to the Courts of the Lord Magister came two people masked and robed as the Lords of Waterdeep of old. Where they came from no one knew, but they appeared in the Castle's Great Hall where the Courts were, and commanded the Lords Magister to leave the city forthwith. Laughing, the Lords Magister refused, whereupon the shorter of the masked intruders (the lady Shilam, apprentice to Ahghairon and his undeclared heir as first Lord of the City) blasted them with lightning and fire, and their very thrones were shattered and toppled.

The taller of the two intruders (Baeron) then called for the heads of the noble houses to come to them, or leave the city forthwith and forever, if they cared not to come by nightfall. All in the Courts heard, and the news was cried in the streets.

The surviving nobles came, reluctantly and with bodyguards, expecting such a summons to be a trap. Baeron spoke to them and the crowd of curious townsfolk that had also come, saying, "this must not happen again." If Waterdeep was to be safe once more, he told them, all must support what he and his fellow Lord now planned, as they had supported Ahghairon in the past. The two would choose others to be Lords as before, he said, and they would rule in secret, as before - save for himself. He removed his mask, and said, "I am Baeron. I would be Lord as Ahghairon was before. I would be safe in this my city again." And the folk of Waterdeep there agreed. Shilarn, still masked, commanded that the houses of the Two Lords Magister be Outcast. There was protest, and she raised her hands that had blasted the thrones, and it was still again. And the house of Gildeggh and of Zoar were outcast.

Peace returned to the city, and Waterdhavians to their labors. To inhibit discovery of who the Lords were, Baeron selected certain men of character whom he knew well, and appointed them Magisters ("Black Robes," they were soon called, from their robes of office) under the Lords, to judge and apply the laws of Waterdeep in daily affairs. These Magisters he paid well, to raise them from temptation, and gave lodgings to those who feared for safety to dwell among the people. To so serve, he told the city, was a burden, not a proud misuse of authority, and if any wished to no longer serve, or were found wanting, they were not to be vilified, but accorded respect. And over the Magisters the Lords sat in their Court, to correct and overrule the judgments of the Magisters. Baeron told the people that none were to decry or belittle any judgments of Magisters that the Lord saw fit to alter or cast aside. If any thought ill of the offices or those who held them they could turn back to the rule of sword and whim, and perish as had those before them. Before the Lord's Court Baeron encouraged people to speak freely for the length of a short candle's burning, without fear of chastisement or reproach from the Lords for anything said, as long as they spoke openly and answered questions or opposing views put to them by any there. Thus, he held, just grievances of folk would be heard, no matter how small the matter or lowly the speaker. And so it was. Slow to take hold, until people knew it for careful justice, but enduring beyond Baeron's time, and beyond Shilarn's time, and beyond the time of their daughter Lhestyn "The Masked Lady," who wed Zelphar Arunsun of Neverwinter, and was mother to Khelben "Blackstaff' Arunsun, a Lord of Waterdeep today, who knows the secrets of long years as Ahghairon did. And as the years have passed, Waterdeep has grown in size and variety, flourishing with good trade under the tolerance and protection of strong defenders and good government. The years passed not without troubles, varying from the Godswar (when Waterdeep played host to gods dying and ascending) to such occurrences as a green dragon assailing the Field of Triumph (part of a plot by the Knights of the Shield to overthrow the Lords' Rule), but the city and her peoples survived and prevailed against all strife. The Lords' Alliance provides continued safety for all the settlements of the northern Sword Coast and those inland, with Waterdeep as the heart of the alliance. Though it can be matched in size or commerce, there is no city the Realms over that compares to the sheer variety of life and experiences found in fair Waterdeep, Crown of the North. ~
@7334  = ~History of the Unicorn Run:  

Bards and sages pass down the tale the headwaters of the Unicorn Run are, in truth, the Font of Life, and a cradle of fecundity.  Each natural race is said to have emerged from the womb of Chauntea onto Toril at the river's source, and then traveled down the Unicorn Run to the outside world.  Some say that a daughter of Chauntea resides at the river's source to usher the newborns into the world, while others claim that Shialla midwifes the process.

Regardless of the truth, the elves, korreds, and halflings all agree that the Unicorn Run is sacred to life and a site of incredible purity.  As a result, all three races have strong taboos about extended trips up the run, for if the river is ever fouled, then no new races will ever be born on Toril again.

@7335  = ~History of the Dead Three:  'KNUCKLEBONES, SKULL BOWLING, AND THE EMPTY THRONE' 

 In ages past there was but one god of strife, death, and the dead, and he was known as Jergal, Lord of the End of Everything.  Jergal fomented and fed on the discord among mortals and powers alike.  When beings slew each other in their quest for power or in their hatred, he welcomed them into his shadowy kingdom of eternal gloom.  As all things died, everything came to him eventually, and over time he built his power into a kingdom unchallenged by any other god.  Eventually, however, he grew tired of his duties for he knew them too well.  Without challenge there is nothing, and in nothingness there is only gloom.  In such a state, the difference between absolute power and absolute powerlessness is undetectable.  

During this dark era, there arose three powerful mortals - Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul - who lusted after the power Jergal wielded.  The trio forged an unholy pact, agreeing that they would dare to seek such ultimate power or die in the attempt.  Over the length and breadth of the Realms they strode, seeking powerful magic and spells and defying death at every turn.  No matter what monster they confronted or what spells they braved, the three mortals emerged unscathed at every turn.  Eventually the trio destroyed  one of the Seven Lost Gods, and they each seized a portion of his divine essence for themselves.  

The trio then journeyed into the Gray Waste and sought out the Castle of Bone.  Through armies of skeletons, legions of zombies, hordes of noncorporeal undead, and a gauntlet of liches they battled.  Eventually they reached the object of their lifelong quest - the Bone Throne.  

"I claim this throne of evil," shouted Bane the tyrant. '''"I'll destroy you before you can raise a finger," threatened Bhaal the assassin. '''"And I shall imprison your essence for eternity," promised Myrkul the necromancer. 

Jergal arose form his throne with a weary expression and said, " The Throne is yours.  I have grown weary of this empty power.  Take it if you wish - I promise to serve and guide you as your seneschal until you grow comfortable with the position."  Before the stunned trio could react, the Lord of the Dead continued, "who among you shall rule?"

The trio immediately fell to fighting amongst themselves while Jergal looked on with indifference.  When eventually it appeared that either they would all die of exhaustion or battle on for an eternity, the Lord of the End of Everything intervened.  "after all you have sacrificed, would you come away with nothing?  Why don't you divide the portfolios of the office and engage in a game of skill for them?" asked Jergal.  

Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul considered the god's offer and agreed.  Jergal took the heads of his three most powerful liches and gave them to the trio that they would compete by bowling the skulls.  Each mortal rolled a skull across the Gray Waste, having agreed that the winner would be he who bowled the farthest.  

Malar the Beastlord arrived to visit Jergal at this moment.  After quickly ascertaining that the winner of the contest would get all of Jergal's power, he chased off after the three skulls to make sure that the contest would be halted until he had a chance to participate for part of the prize.  Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul again fell to fighting as it was obvious their sport was ruined, and again Jergal intervened.  "Why don't you allow Lady Luck to decide so you don't have to share with the Beast?"

The trio agreed, and Jergal broke off his skeletal finger bones and gave them to the players.  When Malar returned form chasing the skulls, he found that the trio had just finished a game of knucklebones.

Bane cried out triumphantly, "As winner, I choose to rule for all eternity as the ultimate tyrant.  I can induce hatred and strife at my whim, and all will bow down before me while in my kingdom."

Myrkul, who had won second place, declared, "But I choose the dead, and by doing so I truly win, because all you are lord over, Bane, will eventually be mine.  All things must die - even gods."

Bhaal, who finished third, demurred, "I choose death, and it is by my hand that all that you rule Lord Bane will eventually pass to Lord Myrkul.  Both of you must pay honor to me and obey my wishes, since I can destroy your kingdom Bane, by murdering your subjects, and I can starve your kingdom, Myrkul by staying my hand."

Malar growled in frustration, but could do nothing, and yet again only the beasts were left for him.  

And Jergal merely smiled, for he had been delivered.

@7336  = ~History of the Last March of the Giants:

East of the Great Rift in the Eastern Shaar once stood a land of the titans.  This empire rose at the dawn of time in Faerun, and its lords thought to challenge the gods in their arrogance.  In punishment, the powers cursed the reigning monarch of the land with fascination and his brethren with devotion.  The powers then dropped a star onto the land.  The impact of the fallen star created a huge valley later known as the Sea of Fallen Stars.  Slowly picking up speed, the gall rolled through the titan nation and onward to the south.

Unable to contain his curiosity, the titan king ran off after the bouncing sphere and his devoted followers dutifully followed his tracks.  The meteorite rolled on and on until it reached the Great Sea and vanished into the depths.  The monarch dove into the sea, and, lemming-like, the entire titan race dove in after him, never to be seen again.

Ashamed at the destruction they had wrought, the powers vowed to keep both curiosity and loyalty firmly in check to avoid such disasters in the future.  They have done so to this day, preventing both new ideas form being pursued with any speed and the intelligent races of Toril from ever fully cooperating.~
@7337  = ~History of the Sisters of Light and Darkness:

This was the birth of the world and the heavens.  After Lord Ao created Realmspace, there was a period of timeless nothingness, a misty realm of shadows before light and dark were separate entities.  Within this dim chaos stalked 13 lords of shadow, the Shadevari - whether they came form elsewhere or are children of the shadow itself, none can say.

Eventually this primordial essence coalesced into twin beautiful goddesses who were yin and yang to each other; they were so close they thought of themselves as one being.  The Two-Faced Goddess created the heavenly bodies of the crystal sphere and together infused them with life to form the Earthmother, Chauntea.  (Although Chauntea has since contracted her essence to encompass only Abeir-Toril, in the beginning she embodied all matter in Realmspace.)  This new universe was lit by the face of the silver-haired goddess, who called herself Selune, and darkened by the welcoming tresses of the raven-haired goddess, Shar, but no heat or fire existed within it.

Chauntea begged for warmth so that she could nurture life and living creatures upon the planets that were her body and limbs, and the two sisters-Who-Were-One become divided, as for the first time they were of two minds.  Silvery Selune contested with her dark sister over whether or not to bring further life to the worlds.  During this great conflagration, the gods of war, disease, murder, and death, among others, were created from residues of the deific battle.  At one point during the battle, Selune seized the advantage and reached across time and space to a land of eternal fire.  Fighting the pain of the blaze, which burned her sorely, she broke off a fragment of that ever-living flame and ignited one of the heavenly bodies so that it burned in the sky and warmed Chauntea.

Incensed, Shar redoubled her attack on her injured twin and began to snuff out all light and heat throughout the crystal sphere.  Again Selune gave of herself and tore the divine essence of magic from her body, flinging it desperately at her sister in defense of life in the sphere.  This essence entered Shar, ripped an equal portion of energy from her, and reformed behind her as the goddess of magic, known now as Mystra, but then as Mystryl.  Though Mystryl was composed of both light and dark magic, she favored her first mother Selune initially, allowing the silver goddess to win an uneasy truce with her more powerful, dark twin.  Consumed by bitterness at her defeat, Shar vowed eternal revenge.

The twin goddesses contested for eons as life struggled into existence on Toril and the other planets under Chauntea's watchful gaze.  Shar remained powerful, but bitterly alone, while Selune waxed and waned in power, often drawing strength from her allied Daughters and sons and like-minded immigrant deities.  Over time, Shar grew strong again, aided by the shadevari who preferred night to blinding light and who stalked the Realms seeking to meld light and dark into shadowy chaos once again.  Shar's plot to reform the world after her own desires was undone when Azuth, the High One, formerly the greatest of all mortal spellcasters and now consort to Mystra (incarnate successor to Mystryl), found a way to imprison the shadevari in a pocket-sized crystal sphere located beyond the edges of the world by creating the illusion of a realm of shadows.  The Lords of Shadow were drawn to investigate, and before they discovered the trick, Azuth imprisoned the shadevari with the Shadowstar, a key of shadows forged by Gond.  The High Lord then hurled the key into the endless reaches of the cosmos allowing life to flourish on in Chauntea's loving hands.~
@7338  = ~History of the Valley of the Gods:  

It is said that even the powers must cavort and amuse themselves once in a great while.  Far to the north of the Spine of the World is the Valley of the Gods.  A paradise unequaled on this world or in the planes, this playground of the gods is nor meant for mortals.  Any mortal who reaches the Valley becomes a deity, for only deities may exist in the Valley.

Old tales tell that luck plays a crucial role in each person's life.  When each new-born baby enters into the Realms, Tymora flips a coin formed from the remnants of the original goddess of luck, Tyche.   Beshaba calls it in the air - the moon (heads) or the cloak (tails).  If Beshaba is right, that person is cursed with misfortune for the rest of his or her days.  If she's wrong, Lady Luck smiles on that child for the rest of his or her life.  For some rare beings, the coin lands edge on - and these luckless few can forge their own fates, for they have more freedom over their destinies than the powers themselves.

During the Tethyr civil war, the Battleaxe of Mauletar was in the possession of the house of Ossyind.  This noble family was betrayed while trying to flee the country, and Mauletar, lead guard and personal friend, took up the axe and sacrificed himself to buy enough time for his companions to flee.  His battle cry was favored by the gods, and was echoed across the lands as a symbol of devoted friendship and loyalty.  Thus, the magical axe was used to uphold these virtues, to be used against those who lacked honor and courage.

@7343  = ~Axe +2 throwing:  'Rhyte's Last Arrow'  
The tale of this weapon lost its significance in the sea of great stories that are told about the High forest, but some bards still sing the song of the skilled archer Adaniss Rhyte.
 
Oh, shocked from the strike of his powerful bow
The slain game sought by Adaniss falls.
Long ago in the time of the Quiet Earth
The hunt from the famed High Forest calls.

The Duke of Everlund known for his boast 
Of the trophies held in his pride as dear. 
Intensely enraged at his rival hunter
Whose bounty by far surpassed his one year. 

One morn tragedy befell the land
With the misconceived death of the Duke's prized hound.
Fallen at the base of a great elm tree 
A bow's shot death in its heart was found. 

With skill so great targets in his eyes were at the mercy of his arrow's flight.
His hands sure and still
Never missing a kill
None could match the marksmanship of Adaniss Rhyte.

The same eve Adaniss called on the Duke
His solemn mistake he wished to repay.
But the noble's rage claimed ten pounds of flesh
And an archer's arm hit the ground that day.

The evil lord demand justice unjust
The most vile curse on his arm to be cast.
Vengeance he sought for the price he had paid
Rhyte vowed the hound's arrow not to be his last.

In sorrow the town helped him forge an axe
Blessed to honor his most glorious day.
With the mark of Rhyte's arrow to guide its strike
And reputed to kill in the very same way.

'With skill so great targets in his eyes were at the mercy of his arrow's flight.
His hands sure and still
Never missing a kill
None could match the marksmanship of Adaniss Rhyte.

Again called the forest with its precious game
And a prize Adaniss with thrill did he seek. 
But none could be finer than the great clawed falcon 
Sought by all amidst the forest's Lost Peaks.

Once more the rivalry of the Duke did stir
For he thought of his skills with Rhyte's bow to be best.
And set his sights on the glorious bird 
To emerge as  the holder of its sainted crest.

The two climbed the peaks and searched days on end
Each of their wills set as strong as the stone.
They found each other at a cliff by chance
Both of their hatreds ran as deep as the bone.

With skill so great targets in his eyes were at the mercy of his arrow's flight.
His hands sure and still
Never missing a kill
None could match the marksmanship of Adaniss Rhyte.

The Duke drew the bow and pulled the string taut
But first flew Adaniss' axe with its blow.
Cleaved, the lord stumbled to cliff's edge and off 
Defeated by Rhyte's last arrow . . .

With skill so great targets in his eyes were at the mercy of his arrow's flight.
His hands sure and still
Never missing a kill
None could match the marksmanship of Adaniss Rhyte.

@7346  = ~Long sword +2:  'Varscona'
Blades of this type were long used by Sharran priests during the sacrificial rites of "Feast of the Moon" ceremonies.  Legends say that, when she passed on, the remains of this sword's wielder were mummified and the blade was placed within her chest as a symbol of power.  In the first stage of a long forgotten ritual, she was to have been exhumed in a season, born again in some new form.  Unfortunately, cult wars killed the few that knew of her existence; her tomb became a prison where she was forgotten, and there she developed a rage that bordered on insanity.  Her grave was eventually found, but it was deserted and gave no indication of her whereabouts.  Some venture to say that her anger was so concentrated, she became one with the very blade of her weapon.  Regardless, after hundreds of years surrounded by constant hate, the sword harvested a power of its own.  It is now exceedingly deadly in combat.

@7347  = ~Short sword +2:  'The Whistling Sword'
Amidst the plains of the Eastern Shaar there lived a small human blacksmith, whose nearly dwarven height did not do his soul justice.  Though a skilled weaponsmith, his true gift was his ability to whistle a heartfelt song that could cause a grown man to cry like a newborn.  Only a reclusive mage shared and enjoyed time with the diminutive man, however, as others could only see his small size as a source of amusement.  Deaf to the smith's song because of their own prejudices, their ridicule slowly grew into cruel torment which eventually persuaded the light-hearted man to leave his home forever.  Before he left he forged this weapon as a gift for his one friend, who also enchanted it during the making.  Thus the blade sweetly whistles to its wielder when unsheathed.  It was not long after that the mage also deserted the small town in disgust, taking the sword with him on his journeys.

Apparently, an industrious little gnome was able to create a special alloy that was capable of retaining a sizeable electric charge. He cleverly wove metal strands of this alloy into his leather work gloves and greeted guests with hilariously shocking results. That is until he shook the hands of a passing dwarven weaponsmith. Rumors say, the shock was so intense that the poor fellows beard caught fire. In exchange for his life, the gnomish inventor relinquished the secret to his special alloy to the dwarven weaponsmith, who now makes a comfortable living fashioning various weapons using the alloy.

With the help of powerful forest animals Hannable slew entire bands of orcs before any more damage was inflicted upon the wood.  The orcs were forced to abandon their plans, lest they suffer the continued wrath of Hannable and the forest.  Needless to say, the hero who aided the grateful dryads lived happily . . . nay, VERY happily ever after!'

When the killing machine was through with its work, Vorusta retrieved the equipment and started the entire process over.

The most notorious owner of this ring made a substantial living exploiting its cursed nature.  Gregoria the Foole, a jester by trade, would use his incomparable sleight of hand to switch this ring with that of a patsy taken from his audience.  The rest of his performance would involve the mocking of the newly clumsy individual, much to the delight of their comrades.  The ring was removed (by a method known only to the wily Jester) only once the stooge had promised no reprisals for the treatment he had received; though Gregoria frequently still had to make a hasty retreat.  His last known performance was rumored to have been an ill-humored mage in Zhentil Keep; a show from which he did not flee quite fast enough.

Zilzanzer was petrified over a dozen times, each time being brought back by his faithful assistant's use of Stone to Flesh scrolls.  Zilzanzer eventually decided that he should make an item to protect him from petrification.  The result was the Ring of the Gorgon.  Sages believe that Beshaba must have smiled upon Zilzanzer when he was born, for he was turned to stone when he put on the ring.  His assistant dutifully read the Stone to Flesh scroll, bringing Zilzanzer out of his stone form.  Unfortunately, Zilzanzer died in the process, this time forever.

Priests of Arvoreen the Defender blessed the cittern with its impressive power.  Relias never intended to play his magnificent creation.  He eventually sold the ruddy instrument to a bard named Gallow Deely.  Gallow was a lanky, slender man often found in the company of adventurers.  Though ill-suited for battle, Gallow was exceptionally gifted at putting tales of heroism to music.  With the aid of the cittern, he helped the Company of Frozen Trees defeat a young green dragon in 1013 DR.

Kay made dozens of enemies everywhere he went because of his acidic wit and appetite for confrontation.  Sages believe that Milil frowned upon Pellon's antics, but that Talos found Pellon's attitude to be quite amusing.  The avatar of Talos watched Pellon start a fight with over twenty men in a bar one night.  As a gift for such destructive entertainment, Talos touched the lute that was laying next to Pellon's unconscious body.  After that night, Pellon discovered that he could make men go berserk just by playing his lute in their direction.  He took great delight in setting mercenaries and sailors against each other for several weeks.  Eventually, Pellon Kay was laid low by a grim-featured warrior with a crossbow who didn't let Pellon get close enough to employ his magical lute.  The unknown warrior threw the lute into the Sea of Fallen Stars.

The plain sword was crafted by a devout worshipper of Tyr named Renold.  Renold spent thirty years of his life perfecting the metalworking techniques that allowed him to craft an almost flawless blade.  As soon as Renold had completed the unadorned weapon, he turned it over to the church of Tyr.  The priest who received it placed the naked blade on his monastery's altar.  He asked his brothers to join him in praying to Tyr to ask their god to bless the weapon with holy power.  The brothers never touched the blade, nor did they speak of it.  After ten years, despite the fact that all of the other brothers lost faith in the blade ever becoming enchanted, the original priest, Edan, continued his prayers in silence.  Another twenty years passed, and there was still no sign from Tyr.  Visiting priests of Helm scoffed at Edan's blind devotion to the blade.   It was then that, without warning, Edan walked up to the altar and gently removed the dust-covered blade from the altar.

The priest of Helm asked Edan if he had finally come to his senses.  Edan replied that he had, that he had been expecting the wrong thing from Tyr the entire time.  He stated that Tyr had done his work long ago.

The priest of Helm laughed out loud at Edan's claim and asked his bodyguard to draw his sword.  The magnificent weapon in the hand of the Helmite had a gilded guard set with pearls.  Runes were etched along the blade, with a small cluster of fine rubies set in the ricasso.  The priest of Helm laughed again and spoke.  "This is truly a sword blessed by the gods.  Your weapon looks like an ordinary soldier's blade.  It pales in comparison."

Edan calmly grabbed the blade by the tang and swatted at the guard's weapon.  The priest of Helm's laughter cut off quickly as he stared down at his retainer's broken weapon.  He stood there speechless as Edan set the blade down and began to reply.

"Justice always pales in comparison to vanity and ostentatious displays of power.  I expected Tyr to manifest his divine will in this blade with lightning and fire.  I should have remembered how the blade was given to me... with simple charity and humility.  Justice is the right of every man, no matter how rich or poor, no matter how educated or ignorant.  It should be found as often in the fields of farmers as it is in the fields of battle."

Edan took the blade to a local weapon smith and had him put a wooden, leather wrapped grip on it.  He then gave it to a fledgling paladin and asked him to always remember the potential for charity and kindness in the human race.

This spell brings forth a dense, smoky cloud in a 10-foot radius. For the first two rounds it's harmless, but on the third round, it begins to spark and flame, doing 1-2 hit points of damage/level of the caster. On the fourth round, it inflicts 1-4 hit points/level of the caster, then drops back to 1-2 hit points per level on the fifth round.

By means of a Ray of Enfeeblement, a wizard weakens an opponent, reducing its Strength and thereby the attacks that rely upon it.  The victim is reduced to a strength of 5 for the duration of the spell, unless a save vs. spell is made.

Similar to Power Word: Silence and Power Word: Kill, Power Word: Stun is another of the words of power. When uttered, it stuns any creature the caster targets, causing them to reel and be unable to think coherently. Creatures with less than 31 hit points are stunned for 4-16 rounds, those with 31 to 60 hit points are stunned for 2-8 rounds, those with 61 to 90 hit points are stunned for 1-4 rounds, and those more than 90 hit points are unaffected. The spell checks the creature's current hit points, not their maximum, so even the toughest creatures can be affected by this spell if they are wounded.

This spell creates a translucent, shadowlike, weightless area of magical force extending from the fingers of one of the caster's hands.  This silent construct is blade-shaped.  Its cutting edges inflict damage just as do those of a real sword.  The caster wields the phantom blade as if proficient with this weapon, at her normal THACO.
        The phantom blade acts as a +3 magical sword in terms of hit and damage bonuses as well as the type of creatures it can hit.  However due to its etheric nature it causes double damage against undead or any other planar creatures.  This sword can only be used by the caster and remains in her hand for the duration or until dispelled.~

Mages need not always be mages -- Tenser's Transformation changes the caster into a heroic fighter, doubling the wizard's hit points, and gives him a +4 bonus to his armor class.

Hopefully I will get another opportunity to search the old meeting hall of the dwarves.  Earlier I uncovered some writings regarding a room within these walls that leads to the lower segments of this complex, and I can only assume that this room lies behind the door I have yet to find.  To make matters worse, the same writings inferred that this room contained a puzzle that was designed to keep the invaders from discovering and desecrating the Cemetery and Forge.  Perhaps Bandoth can provide some more assistance.  ~

Level: 7
Range: Sight of Caster
Duration: 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
This spell summons a shimmering sword of force that can be mentally wielded by the caster. It strikes as if it were being used by a fighter at half the level of the caster, and despite the fact it is held in the hand, it can hit creatures anywhere within the sight of the caster. Although the sword has no bonus to attack, it can hit creatures normally hit only by +2 weapons or greater and inflicts 5-30 hit points with every strike.

Range: 0
Duration: 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None 
This spell enables the caster to create a black, blade-shaped planar rift, about three feet long.  It jumps into the casters hand and is used as a normal sword, remaining there for the duration of the spell.  The caster is considered to be proficient in this weapon.  The sword acts as a +5 weapon and deals 2-24 damage to its victims.  While using this weapon the wizard uses the THACO of a fighter of half his level.  For example if this is cast by an 18th level wizard, he would use combat tables for a 9th level fighter and hence his base THACO would be 12.  Also every time this hits a target the victim must make a save vs. death at +4 or be disintegrated.~

@7861  = ~There was one room within the museum the salamanders avoided, and we were ordered never to enter there.  So naturally, we began to wonder why.  We did our best to try and sneak in to see what it was the salamanders feared, but with little success.  Finally, a woman named Vera managed to do it!~
@7862  = ~What did she find there?~
@7863  = ~~
@7864  = ~Ancient machinery -- really old stuff, most of it in ruin.  However, there was one device that emitted a soft glow and warmth!  Vera realized that the warmth must be why the salamanders avoided the area.  She also concluded the displays of the museum had not always been frozen -- perhaps this machinery was what kept the cold at bay in the past.~
@7865  = ~Interesting conclusion.  Please continue.~
@7866  = ~~
@7867  = ~Vera felt that this was the chance of a lifetime.  There was no way to know if either she or anyone else would ever gain access to this room again so she decided to take action.  She began to fiddle with dials and knobs until suddenly an indicator began to pulse with a steady light.  At once the room filled with a warm glow and the hum of power.  Quietly she returned to tell us of her discovery.~
@7868  = ~I see.  So what happened next?~
@7869  = ~At first, nothing.  For days we waited, always expecting the temperature to rise, but it never did.  We had finally given up hope when, just yesterday, a commotion started and the salamanders fled this room in a flurry of confusion.  Vera saw this as our one chance at freedom.  We could not allow the salamander's time to reorganize and cut off our access to this room.  So, she yelled for all of us to run to the stairs that led here.  Many died in the attempt.  We are the few who survived.  If only Vera were here...~
@7870  = ~Well done... Now, what is this desperate situation you said you were in?~
@7871  = ~We have no food or water.  We are in the heart of enemy lands.  We will surely die if we stay here... the maddening thing is, we *have* discovered another exit that leads back to the surface, but it is locked and we do not have the key.~
@7872  = ~It is probably in the hands of the salamanders. ~
@7873  = ~It is probably in the possession of the salamanders.  I suppose this is where you ask me to risk life and limb to get this key for you.~
@7874  = ~Yes.  We believe that Kerish, their leader, has the key.  Will you recover it for us?~
@7875  = ~Hmm.  Yes, I will try to get this key for you.~

@7883  = ~~
@7884  = ~I am sorry, but no.  Vera never made it down here with the rest of us.  The last I saw, there was a wave of salamanders between her and escape.  I fear she is dead.~
@7885  = ~I am sorry to hear that, Gareth. You mentioned being in a desperate situation. Can you tell me about it?~
@7886  = ~I am sorry to say that she is dead, Gareth.~
@7887  = ~Never!  We would rather die than return to slavery!~

Level: 1
Sphere: All
Range: Sight of Caster
Duration: 6 rounds 
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 25-foot radius
Saving Throw: None
When the Curse spell is uttered, the caster lowers the morale of enemy creatures and penalizes their saving throws and attack rolls by -1. At the instant the spell is completed, it affects all creatures in a 50-foot cube centered on the point selected by the caster (thus, affected creatures leaving the area are still subject to the spell's effect; those entering the area after the casting is completed are not).

Prayer bestows favor on the priest and his allies, and curses their enemies. All attacks, damage, and saving throws by friendly characters gain +1, while enemy attacks, damage rolls and saves are all penalized by 1. Any creatures caught in the area of effect when the spell is cast will continue to be affected by the spell when they leave the area, so if the fighters want to chase down that fleeing goblin, the effects of the Prayer will follow him.

Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 1-6 insects

This spell summons small insects to the caster, then enlarges them to giant size, turning them into fearsome allies. The strength and kind of the insects varies according to the caster's level; the higher level the caster, the stronger insects that are summoned. 
~
@7913  = ~Produce Fire (Alteration)

Sphere: Weather
Range: Caster
Duration: 1 turn/level 
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Sight of Caster
Saving Throw: 1/2
Static Charge is similar to call lightning except it can be used indoors. This spell allows the caster to generate a static charge around any creature within the area of effect, doing 2-16 points of electrical damage, plus an additional 1-8 points for each of the caster's experience levels. The charge keeps going off, once every turn, for the duration of the spell.

Level: 4

Duration: 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 60-foot radius
Saving Throw: None
By reciting a sacred passage or declaration, the priest invokes his deity's blessing upon himself and his allies, while sowing confusion and weakness among his enemies. The priest's allies gain a +2 bonus to their attack and saving throws, and enemies of the priest receive a -2 penalty to their attacks and saving throws. This spell does not nullify a prayer spell - the two may be cast in tandem, and the effects are cumulative.

Duration: Instantaneous 
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 30-foot radius

This spell snuffs out the lives of creatures in the area of effect. The weaker the creatures, the more are affected. For example, this spell could kill 4-80 goblins within the area of effect, 2-40 lizard men, 2-8 ogres, or 1-4 trolls. This spell does not affect undead creatures. Characters slain by a Death Spell cannot be resurrected - they are gone forever.

The effect of a protection from Magic Energy spell lasts no longer than one turn per caster level.

None know better than Halflings the value of a well-placed stone when confronting a larger foe. This particular weapon was the property of a young woman named Arla Surestep, one of the few small-folk that leave the hearth to seek adventure. Legend speaks of the diminutive Arla using this sling to place a well-sharpened pebble through the skull of a green dragon in mid-flight, though the same tale in another tavern places the stone squarely in the creature's hindquarters for more humorous than lethal effect. It would seem that Halflings prefer entertainment over accuracy when it comes to their history.

Along the way, despite his many victories, Kheros became disgusted and terrified by the sight of blood.

His fear eventually spiraled out of control, consuming him with madness.  Priests of Tempus found the huge warrior and took him into safe-keeping.  The priests believed that they could cure Kheros of his fear.  Over several years, Kheros learned the ways of the Tempuran religion, eventually becoming a priest.  His final step in overcoming his fear was being submerged in a tub of blood until he almost drowned.  All the time he was held down, he never struggled, flinched or tried to escape.  In his later years, he had a suit of armor made to remind him of his past.

This war hammer was enchanted by the church of Torm to return charmed wayward combatants to their standard allegiance.  High priests of Torm typically held the hammer in battle, keeping an eye out for anyone who might be swayed to attack his or her comrades through magic.  Redemption was lost when the last high priest to hold the weapon, Ardo Meller, was killed in the Battle of Black Lawns, 1230 DR.  It is believed that agents of the draconic god Tchazzar dragged the weapon from the scene.

Matthain's family, Chamberlain, had a long tradition of producing paladins of Tyr.  Matthain's father, Garlan, slew a powerful high priest of Bane who had been posing a threat to the kingdom.  The priest's evil magic brought him back from the dead.  This priest, called "The Chamberlain Haunt," cursed the Chamberlain family to only produce stillborn children until he had been appeased.  Matthain, as the heir to the family, took it upon himself to remove the curse.  The Chamberlain Haunt told Matthain that he must kill one hundred and one knights of the king.

Matthain began his grim task, slaughtering every knight he came across.  He brought the skull and shield of each warrior to the Chamberlain Haunt as proof of his deed.  The king dispatched bands of knights and heroes to kill Matthain, but he proved too difficult a foe.  Finally, after three years of murdering, Matthain had killed one hundred knights.  He told the Chamberlain Haunt that it was time to end the curse.  The Chamberlain Haunt corrected him, reminding the fallen paladin that he had to kill one hundred and one knights of the king.

Overcome with misery and regret, Matthain nodded and immediately threw himself on his own spear.  With Matthain and Garlan dead, and the letter of his requirements fulfilled, the curse was ended and the Chamberlain Haunt was called to Acheron by Bane, screaming all the way.

Before Ilban, however, Valiant was in the possession of a holy slayer from distant Zakhara.  According to sages, the light sword was crafted to serve an order of assassins.  Valiant's owners survived through many incredible ordeals, mostly because of the magic of the weapon.  The weapon was lost in Calimshan when a holy slayer pursued a pasha's blasphemous agents to Calimport.  The scimitar remained in the hands of Baris Cabal for about a dozen years before the band was broken up by Ilban and his companions.  Ilban's exploits took Valiant into battle against sandmen, giant scorpions, desert raiders, evil sorcerers and the demonic servants of Celan Harad.

Mithran was well known for his love of travel and his acceptance of the "N'TelQuessir," or "not people," the non-elven people of the world.  The cloak was actually the cause of his doom, for it was woven and enchanted by his dark elf lover, Rauva Vrinn.  The style of the black and midnight-blue cloak was so obviously non-elven that his associates became suspicious.  

Eventually, an acquaintance of Mithran, an elven drow-hunter named Gaedel, discovered Rauva's secluded hiding spot in the forests surrounding Myth Nantar.  With a small band of warriors, Gaedel stormed her hut and quickly killed her.  When Mithran discovered what had happened, he went berserk with fury.  The mad mage assaulted the hunting lodge of Gaedel and his brothers, killing them all and leveling the lodge.  Gaedel's family eventually attempted to take vengeance for the act, killing Mithran at loss of most of their house.  Mithran's cloak was recovered by his close friend, the dwarven warrior Hael Bronzelake.  Had it not been, it would have been swallowed up under the waves with Myth Nantar when that proud city was drowned in the Sea of Fallen Stars several years later.

The money you have received from Tranzig should cover your usual fee. Your assignment is a difficult one, but I'm sure that you are up to the task. There is a group of mercenaries who should be coming through Nashkel in the next few days. They are led by a whelp named <CHARNAME>. You are to kill <CHARNAME>, and all that travel with them. I warn you; they might not look like much, but they are very dangerous. Good hunting!

TAZOK
~
@8914  = ~[Note from Davaeorn to Tazok 1]Tazok,
I hope that everything moves along smoothly.  I have written to give you instructions from our superiors.  I have been told that a small band of mercenaries might cause the Iron Throne some trouble in the future.  You are to insure that they don't live to upset our operations.  Obtain the services of the assassin Nimbul, he should serve you well.

DAVAEORN

@8915  = ~[Note from Davaeorn to Tazok 2]Tazok,
I have noticed that your shipments of iron have slowed as of late.  It is imperative that we receive another ton of ore.  Step up your raids, and get a shipment to our base in Cloakwood within the next week.  We need to stockpile as much ore as possible before our ultimatum is given.

My superiors are intrigued by your proposal.  I would like to discuss it further, but not through correspondence such as this.  The Harpers and Zhents have been very active in this region as of late; it would be very unfortunate if they tried to disrupt an alliance between our two organizations.  If you, Bruno, and Thaldorn were to meet with us in the safety of Candlekeep, my superiors would be much relieved.  Please send a response ASAP.

Before dying, they were most forthcoming in their revelations; it is as you had surmised; they were agents of the Zhentarim.  I am also writing to tell you that I cannot attend the meeting at Candlekeep.  Some problems have arisen with The Chill and the Black Talons.  They have had trouble working with each other, and I am needed there to smooth over any dissension.  I am sorry that I will not be at your side.

@8918  = ~[The Personal Diary of Sarevok]Diary

14th of Eleint, 1367:  Today Cormyr has instituted a ban against the Iron Throne from operating within their borders.  While this is a great blow to the Iron Throne, it is the perfect opportunity for Reiltar to approach the Throne high council with his proposal.  If things go well, we could begin the operation within the year.

25th of Marpenoth, 1367:  Davaeorn has sent a message to Reiltar, informing him that the mines at Cloakwood have been drained and are ready for use.  This revelation should help greatly in convincing the Throne high council.

2nd of Nightal, 1367:  The Iron Throne council has agreed to support Reiltar's plan.  He has been given all the resources he needs, as well as leadership of the project.  I have expressed interest to my 'father', and he had promised to include me within the operations along the Sword Coast.  He mentioned mother in our conversation: how I wasn't to be unfaithful to him as she had.  He made it clear that I would suffer her fate if I was.  His threats are weak and hollow, and I shall listen to them for only so long.  I have decided to take this time to make my visit to Candlekeep.  I have waited a long time to research the prophecies of Alaundo, and I must know if the dreams speak the truth.  I will not believe the words of phantoms without proof, and the Priest of Bhaal I confronted gave me nothing. He was old and died quickly in my grasp.  If the words are true, I shall surely groom stronger acolytes than this.

11th of Ches, 1368:  My research has gone well.  The monks here at Candlekeep have been quite helpful.  From what I have read, it would seem certain that the blood of Bhaal does indeed flow through my veins.  His prophecies are (of course) ambiguous, but I think I understand them.  He foresaw his coming death, and seeded his essence across the land. The children born as a result bear the marks of chaos, have power with no direction, and shall feel the blood of a god within them. The deaths they bring shall awaken the father, and through them he will rise. It does not explicitly say, but obviously this means that death wrought by the children will cause them to ascend. Fitting, and since the father was the Lord of Murder, proving one's worth must involve an act in accordance with his portfolio.  I begin to see what I must do.  Death on a god-like scale.

3rd of Tarsahk, 1368:  The monk Gorion troubles me.  He seems to have taken an interest in my readings.  I must be careful to be more clandestine in my research.  I wish I could simply kill him, but I doubt I could safely murder him within this damnable library.

11th of Tarsahk, 1368:  I had a dream this night.  My mother was talking to me, but as she did her face became bloated and discolored.  Her voice became weaker as she spoke to me, telling me to save her from Reiltar.  I could see the garrote cutting into her neck, but I did nothing.  It was only a dream. 

27th of Tarsahk, 1368:  I take my leave of Candlekeep now, and not a moment too soon, for I am sure that Gorion has perceived my heritage.  One thing that I am certain of: <CHARNAME> is, in actuality, one of Bhaal's brood as well.  <CHARNAME> has all the markings, and it would explain Gorion's curiosity of my studies.  Though there is nothing I can do now, I will have to make certain to return and kill the little brat.  It would be foolish of me to let one of my siblings live, especially one being brought up by the Harpers (and I am sure that is where Gorion's allegiances lay).

5th of Mirtul, 1368:  Today I met with Reiltar in Baldur's Gate.  The fool still insists on calling me his son, and for now I will let him.  He assumes that I am loyal to him because he raised me.  Well, loyal I am, but only as long as he is useful.  He's set up a base in the mansion of a destitute noble family and says that everything is running smoothly.  Mulahey has established himself at the mines of Nashkel, and his kobold minions should be already busily contaminating the iron ore.  Only a few slaves have begun to mine out the ore at Cloakwood, though Reiltar assures me that once the bandit raids begin we'll have a steady supply of new slaves.

8th of Hammer, 1369:  I met with the leaders of the Chill, and Black Talons.  I have little liking for Ardenor, the leader of the Chill, but Taugosz seems to be a man of his word.  It is a good thing, as I'll have to work with these mercenaries for the rest of the year.

3rd of Tarsahk, 1370:  Everything proceeds well.  The ore coming from Nashkel has started to deteriorate, and my mercenaries have been doing a fine job at destroying any iron caravans on route to Baldur's Gate.  Though some of my mercenaries have been captured, most think they work for the Zhents, so no trouble has fallen on the Iron Throne.  I am sure that the Zhents at Darkhold won't be pleased to know that their name has been falsely used.   I will have to be wary for Zhentish agents in the coming months.

28th of Tarsahk, 1370:  I think I now have the time to deal with that old codger Gorion, and his little whelp.  I will have to inform my men that I'll be gone for the next few weeks.  


? of Myrtle
No time to write, but I must not neglect my journals so.  The future dead must know of how the Lord of Murder again came to them.  I shall hire a scribe when time allows.  Things have not gone completely as I have planned, but I will still be able to salvage the situation.  <CHARNAME> is on the move to Baldur's Gate; if I could maneuver the whelp to Candlekeep, then I would have the perfect scapegoat for my plan.  My mortal 'father,' Rieltar, is there to meet with the Knights of the Shield.  He has been blocking all my attempts to escalate the hostilities between Amn and Baldur's Gate, and these meetings will only serve to smooth relations.  I must rid myself of them all and assume control of the Iron Throne myself.  I cannot allow petty business and monetary concerns to interfere.  Terribly sorry, 'father,' but my true parentage calls and you are in my way.  I shall be sure to instruct the dopplegangers in the exact manner Reiltar should die.  I think a garrote would be perfect for the task.

I have received your letter and am quite overjoyed by your proposition.  I have told my wife, and she is as excited as I am.   I accept your mission and think that your payment is very adequate.  This will be our greatest feat yet!  To kill three Grand Dukes of Baldur's Gate!  We will be arriving in Baldur's Gate within a week, and should be taking up our usual residence at the Undercellar.  If you wish to contact us, you will find us there.  Use the access points through the sewers.

Joyfully yours,

I must say that our first victim was not the challenge that my wife and I had expected.  The foppish idiot had only the most token of defense.  However, I can assure you that Entar screamed quite deliciously all the way to the end.  I hope that this next mission is much more difficult; from what you have told me it would seem to be.  Assassinating two Grand Dukes in their own palace, while they harangue the high nobles of Baldur's Gate no less!  I can't wait!  You still know where to find us.  You should come down and enjoy the pleasures of the Undercellar for yourself; but if I know you, that'll never happen.

Your obedient servant,

The time to strike is now.  When the party commences on the night of my coronation, you will join up with my doppelganger assassins at the sewer entrance to the palace.  You are to insinuate yourself into the crowd in the ballroom.  When I am finished my speech you will strike.  If you aren't there my doppelgangers will proceed without you, and your payment will be forfeit.  Make sure to keep a leash on your little bitch of a wife.  An invitation to the party is included with this note.

My schemes have come together in a most satisfying manner.  The mercenaries who have plagued my every step are now imprisoned, accused with the murder of Reiltar, Brunos and Thaldorn.  Learn as much as you can about the fate of the mercenaries and then meet me back at Baldur's Gate.  I apologize for leaving you here alone, but it was necessary to return to the city so as to take Rieltar's position as chief of operations.  If things proceed smoothly I will be a Grand Duke within a few weeks.

  As long as Aldeth lives he is a great threat to all of us.  He is friends with the mercenaries who have been stirring up so much trouble in the south.  If he were to confide his fears with them, it could be disastrous.  Kill him, soon!

Your Friend
~
@8925  = ~[Message from Sarevok to Zorl 3]Shalak,
It pleases me that you now count Irlentree among your number, but you must kill Aldeth Sashenstar.  He is a foppish dilettante, with no skill and little intellect.  It confuses me that you have not killed him yet; have your skills withered?  Write back soon - when you have killed Aldeth.

Your Friend.

I must commend you for a job well done.  Without your careful ministrations, Eltan would have remained my most potent foe.  I must now ask for another favor.  Some of your brethren are gathering at the sewer entrance to the palace; they are preparing to assassinate Grand Duchess Liia Jannath, and Grand Duke Belt.  I need you to assist them in their efforts, for you are the craftiest of your kind.  This is the moment I have long waited for, as I hope you have as well.  The bloodshed that will result when I declare war on Amn will be most glorious.  Meet Krystin and Slythe at the Undercellars, they are my best assassins.  There are many access points to the Undercellars through the sewers.

  ...as the lore goes, many great battles were fought between Corellon and Gruumsh.  As Corellon's blood flowed, it mingled with the tears Sehanine shed.   And in this mixture of blood and tears, Corellon's children, the Seldarine were born.  
  Corellon embodies the highest values of that which is elvenkind.  From the gentle aspects of art and poetry to the hasher aspects of war and magic, he is venerated by all the Fair Folk, except that of the drow.  Vigilant over his creations, it is told that Corellon will wander the elven lands, observing his people and defending what is theirs.

By Master E. L. Boyd

  Labelas Enoreth is the elven god of longevity and time.  At the creation of the Fair Folk, Labelas blessed the elves with long lifespans and decreed that their appearances would not be marked by the passage of time.  The lifegiver cooperates with Sehanine in overseeing the lifespan of elves and their growth away from and beyond the mortal realms.  He measures the lives of the Fair Folk and decrees when they should be ended, allowing passage to Arvandor.  As Lord of the Continuum, Labelas governs the orderly passage of time and guards against those who would alter the path of history.  Labelas confers wisdom and teachings on young and old alike, and although he is rarely invoked, the Lifegiver is often praised.  The Lifegiver knows the future and past of every elf, faerie, or sylvan creature.  Labelas is worshiped by sages, historians, philosophers, librarians, and all those who measure the changes wrought by the passing of years.

  ...Sehanine Moonbow is the elven goddess of the moon or, more specifically, the full moon.  She governs divinations, omens, and subtle magics and protects against madness.  She watches over the dreams of the elves, keeping them from harm while in reverie and sending omens to protect them from future dangers.  Sehanine watches over the passage of the elven spirits from the world, and she is protectress of the dead...
  ...Alternately called the wife and daughter of Corellon, Sehanine is the mightiest of the female powers in the elven pantheon.  Identified with the mystic power of the moon, Sehanine's tears are said to have mingled with Corellon's blood and given life to the elven race.

  Shevarash, who embodies the hatred the Fair Folk hold for the drow, is the elven god of vengeance and military crusades.  He is venerated by the elves and half-elves who have suffered the loss of loved ones through violence, particularly those who burn with revenge against the drow, and by those who have sworn to destroy the Spider Queen and the other evil gods of the dark elves.  Some elven theologians speculate that Shevarash serves to gather in the bitterness and hatred that has riven the elven race since the Crown Wars, thus keeping the contagious evil of the Spider Queen from spreading to the elven population at large.~

Solonor Thelandira is the elven god of hunting, archery, and survival in wild and harsh places.  The Great Archer's prowess with the bow is unmatched by any other power venerated in the Realms.  Solonor is concerned with the integrity of nature and the balance between exploitation and agriculture on one hand and fallow, wild terrains on the other...
  ...He instructs the Fair Folk in the art of hiding in and moving through natural foliage so as not to be detected as well as the art of archery and hunting.  Solonor is primarily revered by elven and half-elven rangers, hunters, woodsmen, and fighters.  In particular, elven hunters appeal to him for better catches of game and elven warriors trapped in hostile territory call on him for aid...

@9038  = ~Mythal Theory
By Schend and Melka

... Aside from the High Mages, none are certain about the true nature of mythals, no matter how well versed they are in ancient elven lore of old or current debates on magical theory.  Many agree that a mythal is alive, and is a huge web of magical forces woven together by magic and the lifeforces of the casters.  The mythal is believed to be sustained by the natural mechanisms within and around it, from the wind to the current of a brook or a temperature shift from the energy of sunlight.  Given the ties to life and Faerun, mythals can hardly be common wizardry, no matter what may have been said in the past.  The mythals and their magic are tied directly to the Weave, the source of all Torillian magic...

...contrary to popular belief, our Dwarven friends do not exist on a diet of rocks and dirt.  I was recently invited to visit their wonderful stronghold, Dorn's Deep.  In this architectural wonder, hidden away in one of the most beautiful forests in the North, I entered figuring to be covered in soot from some filthy underground mine unbefitting a High Elf of my stature.  Much to my surprise, my eyes were instead treated to amazing works of beauty and craftsmanship.  Our Dwarven friends proceeded to take me on a tour, pointing out each piece in thorough detail.  I smiled.  Impressed that one of the lesser races had such talent in them to create such works.  Of course, they paled in comparison to what our Elven artisan's can do, but this was not the time to point out their flaws...

Balin,

Deliver these five crates of supplies to the emporium in Easthaven.  Make sure to get a fair price from that unscrupulous Calishite weasel, Pomab.  Use the profit to acquire three barrels of uncarved scrimshaw from Gaspar's warehouse there in Easthaven.  Return to Caer-Dinival with the three barrels and you shall have your agreed upon payment.  Keep your eyes to the tundra.  There have been reports of orcs in the hills outside of Easthaven.  It might be wise to use your advance payment to hire on some extra caravan guards.

This portion of the Deep has been a pleasant surprise, to say the least.  Not only do the ancient dwarven deterrents provide me much seclusion for my work, I have gained the ability to have their spirits become my unwilling servants in knowledge.  Soon I will begin my final transcendence, and my ascended existence within this region will ensure that my power is without challenge.  My new minions, unable to ever find their peace as long as my thoughts occupy what is left of their minds.

Morning Twenty-Three

A curious experience today.  I finally managed to open the door to Jamoth's tomb, and upon entering I was overcome with fatigue.  At first I felt as though I may have unintentionally sprung a trap, but upon revisiting the tomb later I discounted that possibility.  I felt as though life itself was leaving my body, and twisting my coherence.  I will need to investigate this room further in the future, and exercise caution.  I feel as though there may be something within those chambers that would challenge my occupation of these halls.

Morning Twenty-Six

I have given up attempting to open the door to Wyrm's Tooth.  I'd hoped to have visited the area to gather some necessities for my rite of passage, but it appears to be impossible to move the door in any way without its key.  I know from my readings of the lore scattered about here that the key was placed in or around the dwarven monument outside of the cemetery, but its hiding place appears to be impossible to find in the forge's current state.  I'm afraid that without certain resources, the process will render me weaker than I'd originally intended, but I appear to have no choice but to use what I have.

@9553  = ~GNOMES:  Kin to dwarves, gnomes are noticeably smaller than their distant cousins.  Gnomes, as they proudly maintain, are also less rotund than dwarves.  Most have dark tan or brown skin, white hair, and rather large noses.  Gnomes have lively and sly senses of humor, especially for practical jokes.  They have a love for nature that is only matched by their love for gems and jewelry.  Gnomes have natural resistance to magic.  They can see in the dark with infravision.  They gain a bonus to their intelligence scores, but incur a penalty to their wisdom. ~
@9554  = ~HALFLINGS:  Halflings are short, generally plump people, very much like small humans. Their faces are round and broad, and often quite florid.  Their hair is typically curly, and the tops of their feet are covered with coarse hair. Overall they prefer the comforts of home to dangerous adventuring. They enjoy good living, rough humor, and homespun tales. Halflings are highly resistant to poisons and magic. They are naturally skilled with slings as weapons, and have a limited ability to see in the dark. They receive a bonus to their dexterity, and incur a penalty to their strength. There are three racial divisions of halflings within the Realms: the Hairfoot, Tallfellow, and Stout.  ~
@9555  = ~HALF ELVES:  Half elves are a mix of human and elven blood.  They are handsome folk, with good features of each of their races.  A half elf has the curiosity, inventiveness, and ambition of their human ancestors, and the refined senses, love of nature, and artistic tastes of their elven ancestors.  Half elves have a limited resistance to charm and sleep spells.  They can see in the dark with infravision.~
@9556  = ~FIGHTER:  The fighter is a champion, swordsman, soldier, and brawler.  He lives or dies by his knowledge of weapons and tactics.  Fighters can be found at the front of any battle, contesting toe-to-toe with monsters and villains.  A good fighter needs to be strong and healthy if he hopes to survive.~
@9557  = ~RANGER: The ranger is a warrior and a woodsman. He is skilled with weapons and is knowledgeable in the ways of the forest. The ranger often protects and guides lost travelers and honest peasant-folk.  A ranger needs to be strong and wise to the ways of nature to live a full life. ~
@9558  = ~PALADIN:  A paladin is a warrior bold and pure, the exemplar of everything good and true.  Like the fighter, the paladin is a man of combat.  However, the paladin lives for the ideals of righteousness, justice, honesty, piety, and chivalry.  He strives to be a living example of these virtues so that others might learn from him as well as gain by his actions. ~
@9559  = ~CLERIC: The cleric is a generic priest (of any mythos) who tends to the spiritual needs of a community. He is both protector and healer. He is not purely defensive, however. When evil threatens, the cleric is well suited to seek it out on its own ground and destroy it. The opposite is true of evil clerics as well.~
@9560  = ~DRUID: The druid serves the cause of nature and neutrality; the wilderness is his community. He uses his special powers to protect it and to preserve balance in the world. ~
@9561  = ~THIEF: To accomplish his goals, for good or ill, the thief is a skilled pilferer. Cunning, nimbleness, and stealth are his hallmarks. Whether he turns his talent against innocent passers-by and wealthy merchants or oppressors and monsters is a choice for the thief to make. ~
@9562  = ~BARD: The bard is also a rogue, but he is very different from the thief. His strength is his pleasant and charming personality. With it and his wits he makes his way through the world. A bard is a talented musician and a walking storehouse of gossip, tall tales, and lore. He learns a little bit about everything that crosses his path; he is a jack-of-all- trades but master of none. While many bards are scoundrels, their stories and songs are welcome almost everywhere.~
@9563  = ~MAGE:  The wizard strives to be a master of magical energies, shaping them and casting them as spells. To do so, he studies strange tongues and obscure facts and devotes much of his time to magical research.  A wizard must rely on knowledge and wit to survive. Wizards are rarely seen adventuring without a retinue of fighters and men-at-arms. Because there are different types (or schools) of magic, there are different types of wizards. The mage studies all types of magic and learns a wide variety of spells. His broad range makes him well suited to the demands of adventuring.~
@9564  = ~ABJURER:  A mage that specializes in protective magics.~ [AJAN04]
@9565  = ~CONJURER:  A mage that specializes in creating creatures and objects to assist him.~
@9566  = ~DIVINER:  A mage that specializes in detection and divining magics.~
@9567  = ~ENCHANTER:  A mage that specializes in manipulating the minds of sentient beings.~
@9568  = ~ILLUSIONIST:  A mage that specializes in creating illusions to confuse and mislead.~
@9569  = ~INVOKER:  A mage that specializes in manipulating energy.~ [AJAN03]
@9570  = ~NECROMANCER:  A mage that specializes in magic dealing with death.~
@9571  = ~TRANSMUTER:  A mage that specializes in magic that alters physical reality.~
@9572  = ~FIGHTER/ THIEF:  This character can use the abilities of a thief and a fighter, though they cannot use their thieving skills while wearing more than studded leather armor.~

@9574  = ~FIGHTER/ MAGE:  This character can use the abilities of a fighter and a mage, though they cannot cast spells while wearing armor.  Gnomes can choose this multi-class, but become fighter/illusionists by default. Gnomes are the only race that can combine a specialist mage class in a multi-class.~
@9575  = ~MAGE/ THIEF:  This character can use the abilities of a mage and a thief, though they will not be able to cast spells while wearing armor. ~
@9576  = ~FIGHTER/ MAGE/ THIEF:  This character can use the abilities of a fighter, mage, and thief. They cannot use their thieving skills while wearing studded leather, and cannot cast spells while wearing any armor at all.~

@9579  = ~FIGHTER/ DRUID:  This character can use the abilities of a fighter and druid, though weapons are restricted to only those allowed by the druid's ethos.~
@9580  = ~CLERIC/ RANGER:  This character can use the abilities of a cleric and ranger, though weapons are restricted to only those allowed by the cleric's ethos.~
@9581  = ~FIGHTER/ MAGE/ CLERIC:  This character can use the abilities of a fighter, mage, and cleric, though they cannot cast spells while wearing any armor, and are restricted to weapons allowed by the cleric's ethos..~

Minimum: <MINIMUM>
Maximum: <MAXIMUM>~
@9588  = ~You have been given <number> proficiencies to start your character with.  Choose from the above list any of the highlighted proficiencies.  If your character is a fighter he will be able to choose the same proficiency twice.  This will grant him specialization with the weapons listed.  Keep in mind that a character can use any weapon available to his race and class whether he has proficiency with it or not.  However, if he attacks using a weapon that he is not proficient with, he suffers a minus to his attack roll.~
@9589  = ~LARGE SWORDS:  This weapon class allows the character to use Long Swords, Broad Swords, and Scimitars.  The Thief is able to take this weapon class, but he is only allowed to use the Long Sword and Broad Sword. The Druid is able to select this class, but is limited to Scimitars alone.~
@9590  = ~SMALL SWORDS:  This weapon class allows the character to use Short Swords.~
@9591  = ~BOWS:  This weapon class allows the character to use Long bows, Composite Long bows, and Short bows. Only Fighters, Rangers, Paladins, and Bards can use the Composite Long bow. Thieves can choose this category, but are restricted to Short Bows only.~
@9592  = ~SPEARS:  This weapon class allows the character to use Spears.~
@9593  = ~BLUNT WEAPONS:  This weapon class allows the character to use Maces, Clubs, Warhammers, and the Staff. Druids and thieves can choose this category, but are limited to the Club and Staff only. Mages can choose this category, but are limited to the Staff alone.~
@9594  = ~SPIKED WEAPONS:  This weapon class allows the character to use Morning Stars and Flails.~
@9595  = ~AXES:  This weapon class allows the character to use Battle axes and Throwing axes.~
@9596  = ~MISSILE WEAPONS:  This weapon class allows the character to use Slings and Darts.  Clerics can choose this proficiency but are restricted to Slings alone.~
@9597  = ~PICK POCKETS (Thievery):  The thief uses this ability when filching small items from other peoples' pockets, sleeves, girdles, packs, etc.  To use this ability you must use the thievery button.~
@9598  = ~THIEVERY:  A thief uses this ability to pick pad locks, door locks and combination locks.  He also uses it to disable traps.~
@9599  = ~FIND TRAPS:  A thief uses this ability to find small traps, pit traps, and alarms.  This ability does not find large mechanical traps.~
@9600  = ~MOVE SILENTLY:  When the thief uses this ability, he is able to move without making sound.~
@9601  = ~HIDE IN SHADOWS:  Using this ability, the thief can disappear into shadows, or any other type of concealment-bushes, curtains, crannies, etc.~
@9602  = ~You are to choose your alignment.  Your alignment will determine how your character should interact with his environment.  Read over each carefully before choosing.  If you stray severely from your alignment during the course of the game, there will be consequences.~
@9603  = ~LAWFUL GOOD:  Characters of this alignment believe that an orderly, strong society with a well-organized government can work to make life better for the majority of the people. To ensure the quality of life, laws must be created and obeyed. When people respect the laws and try to help one another, society as a whole prospers. Therefore, lawful good characters strive for those things that will bring the greatest benefit to the most people and cause the least harm. An honest and hard-working serf, a kindly and wise king, or a stern but forthright minister of justice are all examples of lawful good people. ~
@9604  = ~LAWFUL NEUTRAL: Order and organization are of paramount importance to characters of this alignment. They believe in a strong, well-ordered government, whether that government is a tyranny or benevolent democracy. The benefits of organization and regimentation outweigh any moral questions raised by their actions. An inquisitor determined to ferret out traitors at any cost or a soldier who never questions his orders are good examples of lawful neutral behavior. ~
@9605  = ~LAWFUL EVIL:  These characters believe in using society and its laws to benefit themselves, Structure and organization elevate those who deserve to rule as well as provide a clearly defined hierarchy between master and servant. To this end, lawful evil characters support laws and societies that protect their own concerns. If someone is hurt or suffers because of a law that benefits lawful evil characters, too bad. Lawful evil characters obey laws out of fear of punishment. Because they may be forced to honor an unfavorable contract or oath they have made, lawful evil characters are usually very careful about giving their word. Once given, they break their word only if they can find a way to do it legally, within the laws of the society. An iron-fisted tyrant and a devious, greedy merchant are examples of lawful evil beings.~
@9606  = ~NEUTRAL GOOD:  These characters believe that a balance of forces is important, but that the concerns of law and chaos do not moderate the need for good. Since the universe is vast and contains many creatures striving for different goals, a determined pursuit of good will not upset the balance; it may even maintain it. If fostering good means supporting organized society, then that is what must be done. If good can only come about through the overthrow of existing social order, so be it. Social structure itself has no innate value to them. A baron who violates the orders of his king to destroy something he sees as evil is an example of a neutral good character. ~
@9607  = ~NEUTRAL EVIL: Neutral evil characters are primarily concerned with themselves and their own advancement. They have no particular objection to working with others or, for that matter, going it on their own. Their only interest is in getting ahead. If there is a quick and easy way to gain a profit, whether it be legal, questionable, or obviously illegal, they take advantage of it. Although neutral evil characters do not have the every-man-for-himself attitude of chaotic characters, they have no qualms about betraying their friends and companions for personal gain. They typically base their allegiance on power and money, which makes them quite receptive to bribes. An unscrupulous mercenary, a common thief, and a double-crossing informer who betrays people to the authorities to protect and advance himself are typical examples of neutral evil characters. ~
@9608  = ~NEUTRAL: True neutral characters believe in the ultimate balance of forces, and they refuse to see actions as either good or evil. Since the majority of people in the world make judgments, true neutral characters are extremely rare. True neutrals do their best to avoid siding with the forces of either good or evil, law or chaos. It is their duty to see that all of these forces remain in balanced contention. True neutral characters sometimes find themselves forced into rather peculiar alliances. To a great extent, they are compelled to side with the underdog in any given situation, sometimes even changing sides as the previous loser becomes the winner. A true neutral druid might join the local barony to put down a tribe of evil gnolls, only to drop out or switch sides when the gnolls were brought to the brink of destruction. He would seek to prevent either side from becoming too powerful. Clearly, there are very few true neutral characters in the world. ~
@9609  = ~CHAOTIC GOOD: Chaotic good characters are strong individualists marked by a streak of kindness and benevolence. They believe in all the virtues of goodness and right, but they have little use for laws and regulations. They have no use for people who "try to push folk around and tell them what to do." Their actions are guided by their own moral compass which, although good, may not always be in perfect agreement with the rest of society. A brave frontiersman forever moving on as settlers follow in his wake is an example of a chaotic good character.~
@9610  = ~CHAOTIC NEUTRAL: Chaotic neutral characters believe that there is no order to anything, including their own actions. With this as a guiding principle, they tend to follow whatever whim strikes them at the moment. Good and evil are irrelevant when making a decision. Chaotic neutral characters are extremely difficult to deal with. Such characters have been known to cheerfully and for no apparent purpose gamble away everything they have on the roll of a single die. They are almost totally unreliable. In fact, the only reliable thing about them is that they cannot be relied upon! This alignment is perhaps the most difficult to play. Lunatics and madmen tend toward chaotic neutral behavior. ~
@9611  = ~CHAOTIC EVIL: These characters are the bane of all that is good and organized. Chaotic evil characters are motivated by the desire for personal gain and pleasure. They see absolutely nothing wrong with taking whatever they want by whatever means possible. Laws and governments are the tools of weaklings unable to fend for themselves. The strong have the right to take what they want, and the weak are there to be exploited. When chaotic evil characters band together, they are not motivated by a desire to cooperate, but rather to oppose powerful enemies. Such a group can be held together only by a strong leader capable of bullying his underlings into obedience. Since leadership is based on raw power, a leader is likely to be replaced at the first sign of weakness by anyone who can take his position away from him by any method. Bloodthirsty buccaneers and monsters of low Intelligence are fine examples of chaotic evil personalities. ~

@9734  = ~A lesser-known weapon, historically only used by rangers serving Mielikki, this blade has a very humble and simple background.  The Cradle of Mielikki was originally blessed by a triumvirate of druids for a ranger named Kell Pathwalker.  Kell led a peaceful life, fending off the occasional orc or goblin who might wander into his lands.  When he died of old age, the druids had no one to pass the blade on to.  The oldest of them, Bimon, held onto the scimitar, but never used it in battle.  When Bimon and his associates left their grove for an extended period of time, a wandering mercenary robbed the hollow tree of its riches.  He carried the scimitar north to the Spine of the World, where he died of exposure.

Sphere: Necromantic
Range: Sight of Caster
Duration: 8 hours
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 
This spell creates the lowest of the undead monsters, skeletons or zombies, usually from the bones or bodies of dead humans, demihumans, or humanoids.  The spell causes these remains to become animated and obey the simple verbal commands of the caster.  The undead remain animated until they are destroyed in combat or are turned; they cannot be dispelled.  The caster can animate one skeleton or one zombie for each experience level he has attained.~

@9750  = ~[no text]~
@9751  = ~Sure.  What do you know about Poquelin?~
@9752  = ~Poquelin is no priest of Ilmater.  He is a sorcerer of some sort.  There is something cold and unnatural about his eyes.  His skin, his hair... everything about him rings false.  The way he walks, the way he holds himself... it is as though he is a stranger in his own body.~
@9753  = ~Interesting.  Could you heal me?~
@9754  = ~~
@9755  = ~My... my god.  You have delivered us from such a terrible nightmare...  I dreamt that I was swimming in pitch under a blood red moon.  So much suffering have I caused.  So much suffering must I endure to repay the debt of sin I have incurred.  I am sorry that I sought to cause you harm.~
@9756  = ~How did all of this happen?~
@9757  = ~I bow before you in thanks, my friends.  Although I am unworthy to truly consider myself to be your equal, I ask if there is anything I can do to help you.~

@9763  = ~Giant's Sleep~
@9764  = ~This weapon was used by the human ranger Althax Grom.  Althax hated the giants that plagued his homeland and was trained to exterminate them from a young age.  Although Althax originally fought his foes using the sword and bow, he quickly decided that those weapons were too slow against his huge foes.  His druid friend, Eladan, enchanted this hammer for him.  The reputation of the weapon grew as legends of Althax grew.  Even though the warhammer has passed through many hands since Althax's untimely demise, Giant's Sleep will always be remembered as the weapon of that powerful warrior.

@9775  = ~What would he think?~
@9776  = ~This is a very detailed sculpture.  How do you manage to do it without having Marketh here?~
@9777  = ~He would think that the world had become the Worm's Lair.  What I'm doing here... it's a disgrace.  If my son's life weren't at stake, I wouldn't have any part in it.~
@9778  = ~The sculpture you're making of Marketh... how do you get so much detail on it without having him here?~
@9779  = ~When we svirfneblin sculptors see a person's face, it becomes a block of stone.  Inside of every block of stone, there are a million faces.  By looking at a block of stone, we instantly know how to chisel away everything that is not the face we see in our minds.~

@9781  = ~Wooden Shawm~
@9782  = ~No.  Actually, we just use this drawing of him.  It's pretty good.  Flozem, one of Lord Chamberlain Marketh's bodyguards, drew it.  You can have it if you want.  We already have most of the detail done.  The face and the ring were the hardest parts.~

@9788  = ~This was the weapon of a cursed soul, doomed to wander the length and breadth of Faerun for his crimes against the elves of Myth Drannor.  Denell Harband was a human involved with the creation of the "Halfaxe Trail."  Under the orders of his commander, Halvan the Dark, he forged ahead through elven forests despite protests and repeated attacks.  When he was finally captured by the elves, he stated emphatically that he was free of guilt because he was just following his orders.  The elven council deemed that Denell be placed under a High Geas to carry his axe from the Sword Coast of Faerun to its borders in the east, and from the Great Glacier to Lurien.  It took Denell thirty years to complete his task.  When he finished, he was an accomplished warrior, weathered and beaten by years on foreign roads.  On his way back to his home, he passed by Harrowdale and saw a wooden statue of Halvan the Dark raised proudly in a small town square.  With a single-handed blow, he lodged his huge axe into Halvan's forehead.  Never breaking stride, he returned to his hut where he lived out the rest of his days as a reclusive farmer.

Kedl eventually sold his bracers when he needed the money for some powerful rings.  Unfortunately, Kedl died in an orc attack on Phlan several years later.

Kivan and his mate Deheriana were apparently on a romantic sojourn years ago when they were waylaid by a group of Brigands. They were captured and tortured for the amusement of Tazok, the half-ogre that led the attack. Kivan eventually escaped, but Deheriana did not survive the encounter. Kivan is a man of few words, and obviously does not make friends easily. Likely he will not take much pleasure from life until he has revenged the death of his love. ~

@10183 = ~When asked about her past, ALORA reveals that she was originally from Iriaebor. As a child she was cute, outgoing, and dangerously curious, causing no end of trouble for her parents. They tried to curb her lunatic behavior, and encouraged her to be content with home and hearth like other halflings. Alora found this unbearably stifling, and left to explore the world. She quickly found herself falling into all sorts of trouble, going to the wrong places and angering the wrong sorts of people. Eventually she found herself in the city of Baldur's Gate, and it was there that she discovered her future profession: thievery. Wealth was never her chief concern; it's just that too many interesting things are behind locked doors. Her unassuming temperament makes it easy for her to hoodwink the authorities, and her sweet nature has saved her from a jail cell numerous times.~

@10185 = ~When asked about his past, MINSC proudly announces that he is a berserker warrior from the nation of Rasheman in the utter east. He is currently undertaking his dejemma, a ritual journey to manhood, and is seeking adventure and glory in battle. It is also his honor to be the bodyguard of a young Wychalarn of Rasheman named Dynaheir, and if anyone tries to harm her he will beat sense into their heads until they reconsider. He is unsure as to why she has led them to the Sword Coast, but his loyalty is unquestioning. If he serves her well and distinguishes himself in battle he hopes to be accepted into the Ice Dragon berserker lodge upon return to their homeland. So far Minsc considers his most notable experience in the world abroad to be the acquisition of his animal companion 'Boo,' a creature that he claims is a miniature giant space hamster. Apparently such things do exist in the Realms, but Minsc has surely taken too many blows to the head. He seems a good-natured fellow, but is all too willing to indulge his berserker nature. ~

Minsc is on his 'dejemma,' a right of passage, and it appears that she may be involved in something similar. Of this, she will only state that great things are foretold for the Sword Coast. She seems very sure of herself, is possessed with an old-world sensibility, and is very demanding of her companions.

@10195 = ~When asked about his past, YESLICK quietly states that he was once a member of the dwarven clan Orothiar. For generations they used the iron mine in the center of Cloakwood as their home, but almost a century ago catastrophe struck. As skilled as they are underground, dwarves occasionally make mistakes.  One such incident cost them dearly. They apparently breached an underground river and the resulting flood claimed nearly all of the clan. Yeslick was one of the few survivors, and made his way to Sembia to start a new life. There he made the acquaintance of Rieltar, a member of the Iron Throne, and was hired as a personal smith. They became friends, and eventually Yeslick told of his past. This proved to be his undoing, as Rieltar used this information to formulate a plan to expand the Iron Throne power base in the Sword Coast.  Rieltar betrayed his supposed friend and forced him to reveal the location of the mines. Yeslick has been imprisoned ever since so as not to reveal the site to others. Now he wishes for nothing but the chance to right the wrongs that have been committed using his ancestral home.~
@10196 = ~When asked about his past, CORAN reveals that he hails from the Forest of Tethir, and while he has great memories of his time there, the serene lifestyle he felt it offered was ultimately not for him. Instead he traveled to the city of Baldur's Gate, dreaming of wealth, power, and respect. With nary a coin to his name he resorted to thievery, stealing only from those that he felt could spare it, and swearing that he would quit once he had enough gold to start his own business. Unfortunately he soon grew to love his new lifestyle, looking forward to each hair-raising escape, dangerous break-in, or beautiful woman. Occasionally he would need to leave town for a while, disappearing into the wilderness until things had cooled down and his name was less known. His most recent retreat is apparently the result of a relationship with the female sorceress Brielbara. He sheepishly admits to being caught in the act of seducing a female member of the Knights of the Unicorn, and being forced to flee from the violently jealous mage.   ~
@10197 = ~When asked about his past, AJANTIS announces that he is a squire-paladin of the Order of the Most Radiant Heart, and that he enforces the power and discipline of Helm. He belongs to the noble family of Ilvastarr in Waterdeep, and has studied swordplay under such luminaries as Myrmith Splendon. His skill and devotion apparently brought him to the attention of the paladin Keldorn, one of the most respected of the order, who decided to take Ajantis under his wing as a squire. Recently Ajantis has asked for the honor of becoming a full-fledged member of the order. To accomplish this he has traveled to the Sword Coast, in order to help curtail the increased humanoid activity in the region. If he succeeds in his quest the order will vote on his eligibility for membership. He seems utterly devoted to his mission.~
@10198 = ~When asked about his past, KHALID nervously reveals that he was born and raised in the nation of Calimshan. He does not say much of his parents, but you get the feeling that his merchant father thought little of him, devoting much more attention to Khalid's half brothers. Khalid thus threw himself into the martial pursuits, studying under members of the city militia. He doesn't go into detail on how he met Jaheira, but his adoration of her is obvious. When asked about how he knew Gorion he will only say that they had long been friends, and that many shared acquaintances will mourn his loss with harpsong. ~
@10199 = ~When asked about her past, JAHEIRA glares as she speaks. She says that she was born in the Tethyr region to a loyalist of the King Alemander regime, unfortunately during the Tethyrian civil war. Her family was among the nobles targeted by the angry mobs of peasants, and she was only spared because a servant girl took her from their castle before it fell. They fled into the forest of Tethyr and stumbled across an enclave of Druids willing to take the child. Jaheira grew up a very headstrong girl, believing that the only way to protect nature was to have an active role in the world. She seems to have little in common with Khalid, but even though her manner is often confrontational she apparently cares deeply for him. Her admiration of Gorion is obvious, and she plainly states that whomever was responsible for his death will suffer an equal fate.   ~
@10200 = ~When asked about his past, GARRICK explains that he was part of a celebrated acting troupe called the Dale Wind Troubadours. They traveled the length of the coast from Neverwinter to Amn and often played to Dukes and other nobility. Indeed, few others could afford the cost of a performance when the group was at its peak. Garrick does not speak fondly of this time however, as the direction the group was taking left him dissatisfied with their conduct. He apparently discovered that performances were being used as distractions for thievery and declared he would have nothing to do with it. Rebuffed by his comrades, now he wishes simply to travel and play his music for those that will listen. He seems a bit young and naive, and a touch too ready to take the word of a stranger. ~
@10201 = ~When asked about her past, SAFANA spins tale upon tale involving fantastic liaisons with pirate captains, nobles, and royalty of all shapes and sizes. The consistent details seem to be that she grew up in the city of Calimport, surrounded by luxury. Her father was a very influential noble, and though she could have had anything, she apparently found herself too confined by her father's protective arm. She ran away in her early teens with the help of the first mate of the pirate ship 'Exzesus,' and remained with the crew for several years as they raided up and down the Sword Coast. Eventually she tried to manipulate the captain and found her self in a lot of trouble, escaping when the ship was at port in Baldur's Gate. She has many stories of her escapades after that, but if there is a grain of truth in them you certainly cannot find it.  ~
@10202 = ~When asked about her past, FALDORN states that she was the child of a Black Raven Uthgardt woman. As an infant she was given over to an enclave of Shadow Druids as an offering, and was thereafter raised according to their beliefs. A splinter group of the main druidic order, Shadow Druids engage in very aggressive protection of nature, often relying on violence to achieve their aims. Faldorn showed great promise as she approached adulthood, and the order decided to send her to the Sword Coast to test her devotion to their ideals. Her ongoing mission is to use any means available to stop the despoiling of nature, no matter the risk or the cost to her life or any other. ~
@10203 = ~When asked about her past, BRANWEN reveals that she left her home of Seawolf in the Norheim isles at an early age. She was apparently reviled by her own people for wanting to become a priest, a station reserved exclusively for the men of the village. She harbors no resentment, realizing that her faith must face such tests or be worthless. She traveled the coast, offering her services to local militias, and eventually came into the employ of an adventuring troupe in the Nashkel area. Branwen had no idea that the group was participating in banditry however, and on their first raid she balked at attacking a caravan of unarmed merchants. She rebelled, and a mage named Tranzig turned her to stone in the ensuing fight. Despite the unfavorable outcome, Branwen feels that Tempus views her actions approvingly. To attack those that are unarmed is the basest of villainy.~
@10204 = ~When asked about his past, QUAYLE talks for a good hour about his worship of Baravar Cloakshadow, how he is well on his way to mastering sorcery, and just generally how incredibly smart he is compared to everyone else in the party.  He was apparently encouraged to strike out on his own as soon as he came of age because, as he claims, he was simply too gifted to remain in that stifling environment. You get the feeling, however, that no one was terribly broken up over his leaving. He says that he apprenticed in the arts of magic and the worship of Baravar under a gnome named Gifos, though it was not long before this teacher also sent him on his way. Since then, Quayle has wandered the Sword Coast looking for people who were willing to accept his "his wisdom and instruction." It has likely been a long walk.~
@10205 = ~When asked about his past, XAN wistfully speaks of his home in the elven stronghold of Evereska, and his role as a Greycloak. It was apparently decreed that he was to investigate the events of the iron shortage, determine who or what were the causes, and ascertain whether there was a greater threat to the region as a whole. This was definitely not a small task, and he accepted the responsibility with a great deal of dread. You get the feeling, however, that he approaches everything with a great deal of dread. He has devoted his life to improving his mastery of magic and has become a skilled wizard, though this dedication has left him little time to make friends or acquire any other pastimes. He strikes you as very capable, though probably not the best influence on morale. ~

@10207 = ~When asked about her past, SKIE bubbles that she is the daughter of Entar Silvershield, one of the Grand Dukes of Baldur's Gate. Her admittedly sheltered life has consisted mostly of learning ballet, history, and languages. Being exceptionally agile she has become a very proficient dancer, though this natural dexterity has mainly allowed her to better sneak off on sojourns away from the estate. She says she finds the nastier areas of Baldur's Gate exciting, though she seems naive about the dangers. On one of her escapades she met up with the debonair Eldoth, and thinks that he can help her live the life of adventure that she craves. She trusts him implicitly, perhaps too much so.~
@10208 = ~When asked about his past, ELDOTH speaks as though his every word should impress and dazzle. He really seems to enjoy talking about himself. He is apparently from the island kingdom of Ruathym, though he left as a teenager for the city of Waterdeep. His natural affinity for song and poetry was honed to perfection while he trained at the musical college of New Olamn, supporting himself with gold borrowed from any one of his given lovers. It would seem that his skill in music is mirrored with his talent in the manipulation of others' emotions. He skims over explaining how he came to leave Waterdeep, but it was apparently the result of an attempted tryst with Aleena Palidinstar. Piergeiron, lord of the city, discovered that his daughter was being used by a manipulative dilettante and likely became quite furious. Eldoth probably had to flee the city, deciding it was time to use his bard skills elsewhere. ~

@10213 = ~When asked about his past TIAX ignores you entirely, preferring instead to loudly proclaim what is in store for his future. He obviously worships Cyric, but also seems to share a touch of his madness. Tiax unquestioningly believes that he is destined to rule the world, and his fervor makes him blind to the ridiculous nature of the goal. He seems harmless enough for now.~
@10214 = ~When asked about his past, KAGAIN stresses that the questioner should just mind their own business if they want to keep their teeth. It is apparent that he runs a rather shady mercenary company and that he is quite obsessed with wealth, but any information beyond this he is content to keep to himself.~
@10215 = ~When asked about her past, SHAR-TEEL has very little to say.  From the little she speaks of it can be gleaned that she is an orphan. She also seems to harbor an intense dislike for Flaming Fist mercenaries, as well as an obvious disrespect for men in general. She seems to have something to prove, and likely her childhood was not of storybook quality.~
@10216 = ~When asked about his past, EDWIN sneers that he has no intention of revealing such information and that it is none of your business. He further states that you are lucky enough to simply share his company, and then mutters something about leaving whenever he wishes. He obviously cares little for the camaraderie of others, and seems to take more pleasure in speaking to himself than in interacting with the party. His attire brazenly displays the colors of the Red Wizards of Thay, though why a member of that organization would come so far west is puzzling. Edwin does not seem forthcoming with any information.~
@10217 = ~When asked about her past, VICONIA reveals (quite proudly) that she is a dark elf from the Underdark city of Menzoberranzan. She says very little about her reasons for leaving that sunless realm, though separations of such a nature are never gentle. She does claim to no longer worship the spider goddess Lolth; a change that even you know is often fatal. Her new faith is in the night goddess Shar, an appropriate choice for a drow, though this is not a firm indication that she has given up the brutal ways of her people. She finds the laws of the surface world quaint and more than a little strange, but this is simply because of her lack of experience. Likewise she seems a bit naive about how her race is viewed by surface dwellers. Many will not give her the chance she seems to expect, and even being seen with her may affect how people think of you. You know that as a drow, she has resistance to magic, both beneficial and harmful.~

@10220 = ~This blade resists any attempt at using it. Likely it is attuned to its owner and none other can wield it. The hilt bears the name "XAN." ~ [GAM_47]
@10221 = ~These arrows are strangely constructed; apparently notched such that only their creator can fathom their use.~ [GAM_47]

@10233 = ~When asked about her past, IMOEN slaps your shoulder playfully. She says that you of all people should know, seeing as how you grew up together. Indeed, some of your fondest memories are of meeting this sprightly young lass. She apparently came to Candlekeep much as you did, though 10 years later in life, and she spent much more time with the gruff Winthrop than Gorion. "Puffguts" she would call him, much to the old innkeep's dismay. 
She seems the eternal child, and is quite content to play the part of little sister, though you are both of comparative ages. You can tell by her hearty smile that she will always be willing to travel with you, no matter what path you take.~

@10291 = ~Spider's Bane~
@10292 = ~Spider's Bane was originally forged by the dwarves of the Orothiar tribe in Cloakwood.  They created the blade to help foster good will between them and the Grand Dukes of Baldur's Gate.  Wielded by the Grand Dukes for about a century, the sword was eventually lost, ironically in a fight against ettercaps and spiders.  Who wields the blade is now unknown, but its recovery would aid greatly in fighting the current spider infestation that plagues the Cloakwood.

It seems that there are evil forces stirring in the mountains nearby.  He believes this evil is somehow affecting the weather in the pass, causing the ring of warmth that centers around Kuldahar's Great Oak to slowly shrink.  He also believes that the evil is behind the numerous monster sightings and the mysterious abductions about town.  We have agreed to help discover the source of the evil by investigating a nearby vale.  Apparently, there have been rumors of undead stirring within some ancient crypts located within this "Vale of Shadows."  We are to travel to the Vale, discover if there is a connection between the undead and the disturbances in Kuldahar, then return to Arundel with whatever information we find.~

@10758 = ~Not that it's any of your business, but I suppose you're better company than the giants... My superior has requested that we dismantle the Great Forge.  We are using the metal to construct a longboat of immense proportions.~
@10759 = ~When the ship is finished, the giants will row it down the great lava rapids just beyond that rock.  From there, they will pick up speed and ram into the cavern wall roughly a quarter of a league away.  When the wall breaks, the lava will pour into the large, low cavern beyond.~
@10760 = ~In that cavern lies the dark elf city of Rilauven.  Drow always flaunt their resistance to magic.  Well, we'll see just how resistant they are to lava and giant, two hundred pound broad swords.  Poquelin wants to make sure our rear guard isn't crushed by those black-skinned schemers.~
@10761 = ~Besides that, my job is pretty straightforward.  In our spare time, Malavon and I are attempting to use Saablic Tan's Red Wizard formula to create black unicorns.  Once I locate the herd that occasionally mills around the Severed Hand, it should be simple enough to lure a few my way with my virginity and the help of a necklace that masks my "true nature."~

@10767 = ~Ha, ha!  Yeah, "Hail Ilmater!"   That's a good one.  Oh!  I think it's time for you to hand over your badge now.~
@10768 = ~Oh, shut up.  What I am supposed to do, listen to our elders and watch as the greatest race on Toril drifts into the western sea?  To the Abyss with the Retreat, the houses, and the Seldarine, for all I care.  And, since you appear to not approve of my life and how I live it, to the Abyss with *you.*~
@10769 = ~He's relatively pleased, yes.  Progress was slow when King Thargren was in charge.  After a pack of water elementals and salamanders killed him, Poquelin put me in charge of the fire giant clan.  I've provided the tactical knowledge the fire giants lack.~
@10770 = ~The salamanders are a crafty bunch, though.  They recognize that without my leadership, they could probably rally the elementals against the fire giants.  They try to sneak over here to kill me, using houses for cover.  That's why I ordered the fire giants to crush them.  We had to put metal plates in the ground to prevent the earth elementals from killing me when I slept.~

@10773 = ~Well, I'm sorry, but I don't think I'm going to let that happen.  You seem like trouble to me.~
@10774 = ~*Some* of the salamanders are our allies.  Shikata isn't powerful enough to bully them all into obedience, so a faction of salamanders broke off.  They realized that the dismantling of the forge would cause the portals to the Elemental Plane of Fire to be destroyed.  If that occurred, the salamanders would have to compete for heat.~

Dual-classing is a significant change to your character. Please be sure you have read and understand the following, as well as the description given in the Icewind Dale manual (and the Heart of Winter manual, if you have the expansion). 

Dual-classing is an ability only humans have. It is the process by which you stop advancing in your current class and begin advancing in a second class. You will retain the benefits and abilities of the first class at its current level, but from then on you will only gain experience in the second. 

In order to become dual-classed, you must be of at least 2nd level in your current class. Your character must have scores of 15 or higher in the prime requisites of the current class, and scores of 17 or more in the prime requisites of the class you wish to change to. Some classes cannot be combined due to alignment conflicts or inherent restrictions. Within Icewind Dale all resulting mixes must be viable multi-class combinations as well.

Dual-class characters have much the same requirements as multi-class characters. You must abide by the restrictions of the individual classes. For example: a Mage combination cannot cast spells while wearing armor, a Thief combination cannot use thieving skills wearing armor other than leather, and a Cleric or Druid combination cannot use weapons that their ethos does not allow.

After attaining at least second level in your first class you can opt to change to a second class, provided you have the prerequisites and do not have any alignment conflicts. Your first class becomes "inactive," and you begin again at 1st level with 0 experience points in your second class. From then on you progress as a single-classed character in your new class. ONCE YOU HAVE CHANGED TO A SECOND CLASS YOU CANNOT GO BACK TO THE FIRST. Your first class will forever remain at its current level.

You will be unable to use the abilities of your first class until you have attained ONE LEVEL HIGHER in your new class. For example: If you were a 4th level mage and switched to a fighter, you would not be able to use your mage abilities again until you reached 5th level as a fighter.

IMPORTANT: The experience cap in Icewind Dale is 1,801,000 points for a single character; in the expansion pack, Heart of Winter, the experience point cap has been raised to 8,000,000. Experience points from BOTH of a dual-classed character's classes count towards this total. Please be sure that there are sufficient points left available to allow you to progress high enough in your second class! The game will still allow you to dual if you wish, but you may not be able to access your previous class' abilities ever again. This may result in difficulty later in the game.~
@10812 = ~Hmm.  Where can I find this man?~
@10813 = ~~
@10814 = ~I don't know.  I'm not sure I want to know, either.  Every once in a while, when Marketh comes here, I have the urge to jump up and hit him.  I thought about doing the same thing when Poquelin came here.  As soon as I did, he grabbed my face and looked right into my eyes.  It was like he knew.~

Level: 5
Range: Touch 
Duration: 3 rounds/level
Casting Time: 5
Area 'of Effect: The caster 
Saving Throw: None 
This spell is similar to the 7th-level Spell Turning, which causes the spells cast against the wizard to rebound upon the original caster.  This effects a total of 4 spell levels.  This includes spells cast from scrolls and innate spell-like abilities, but excludes the following: area effects that are not centered directly upon the wizard as well as area effects that are stationary such as cloud kill and stinking cloud.  As long as the spell is cast directly at the wizard it will be reflected back upon the caster.  This spell will only effect up to 4th level spells, but as long as there are levels remaining then the spell will be absorbed.  For example if there is only 1 level left and a 3rd-level spell is cast at the wizard, the spell will be reflected while canceling the spell turning.  Still don't know how this will work with dispel magic.~

After all, they have very little protection should monsters be in the area.  Bah!  Perhaps my brothers are right.  We elves were not meant to interfere in the world of men.  These lands may once have belonged to our people, but that was long ago.  It is the territory of the wild Reghed barbarians and the Ten-Towns now.  Why resist the tide against us?  Those who do often turn to the darkness of war and conquest to reclaim the lands that we once ruled.  It is an endeavor doomed to failure.  Oh, there I go again.  Corellon help me, I'm starting to sound like cousin Xan!"~

@10993 = ~Lore of the Bladesingers
By McComb and Pryor

  An elite group of elven fighter mages, the blade-singers are dedicated to the defense of the elven nation, and many of them journey back to Faerun to help defend those elves who stayed behind or have yet to join the Retreat.  
  Bladesingers are terrifying weapons experts and spellcasters.  On Evermeet they are organized into small warrior lodges, each specializing in a different weapon.  They are even more dedicated to the ancient ways and styles of dress than other Silver elves.  They often tattoo themselves with old runes and symbols and their armor and weapon are all of great antiquity and beautiful craftsmanship.

Level: 4
Sphere:  Healing
Range: Touch
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: Target Creature
Saving Throw: None
This powerful spell enables the priest to imbue 1 creature with the ability to regenerate.  This regeneration will heal any wounds and even regenerate lost limbs.  The creature effected will regain 1 hit point per round for every 2 levels of the caster.  The effect lasts for 1 round per level of the caster or until dispelled.  For example a 14th level priest would regenerate 7 hit points per round for 14 rounds.~

@11000 = ~  ...so it has come to this.  The orc and goblin forces grow stronger with each victory.  Where they attained the weapons of the alliance is still a mystery, but I believe in my heart that it was not through the dwarves.  We have succeeded in stifling their advances but it won't hold for long.  We have taken severe casualties and our forces are dwindling rapidly.

Negotiations are over with our former friends.  We are now in open conflict with them.  As much as I love my father, I blame him for this.  Ever since we found the weapons in the horde's possession, father has been completely irrational.  Any discussions had with our former friends ended in bitter accusations and resentment.  He adamantly believes that the dwarves betrayed us and listens to nothing they have to say in their defense.

Am I the only one who sees that both sides are going to die horribly if this continues?  Father does not see reason in putting aside hostilities with the dwarves so that we may unite against our common enemy.  I spoke to him of going Dorn's Deep to approach our old friends.  He lashed out at me in anger and sent me out of the astrolabe.

I now make preparations to leave home and ride to Dorn's Deep myself.  I know in my heart what must be done and this is the only way.  Perhaps I have more of my father's stubbornness than I thought.~

Level: 7
Sphere:  Protection
Range: Touch
Duration: 3 rounds/level
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None
This powerful abjuration spell causes the spells cast against the priest  to be absorbed and consumed.  This effects a total of spell levels equal to half the level of the priest.  This includes spells cast from scrolls and innate spell-like abilities, but excludes the following: area effects that are not centered directly upon the priest as well as area effects that are stationary such as cloud kill and stinking cloud.  As long as the spell is cast directly at the priest it will be absorbed.  The biggest difference between this spell and Spell Turning is that as long as there are levels remaining then the spell will be absorbed.  For example if there is only 1 level left and a 3rd-level spell is cast at the priest, the spell will be absorbed while canceling the shield.  This also works against dispel magic. ~

Level: 6
Sphere: Healing 
Range: Touch 
Duration: Permanent 
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.
When this spell is cast, the caster gains the ability to touch a target and inflict tremendous damage, reducing the target to all but 1d4 hit points.  A saving throw vs. spell negates the effect.  This spell has no affect on undead, constructs, or extraplanar creatures.  Harm can only be cast by evil characters.~

The shaft is crafted to resemble an elven femur, wrapped in tanned elf skin.  A stout chain connects the shaft to a spiked ball.  The entire creation is forged out of meteoric iron.  It is a testament to the potential of orcish craftsmanship.

@11581 = ~Alamion~
@11582 = ~This long sword is part of a matched pair of weapons, the other being the short sword Malamion.  Alamion's blade is slightly thinner than a typical long sword blade and features a thin fuller down the center.  Acid-etched snowflake patterns are scattered along the length of the blade, most of them concentrated towards the hilt.  The hilt of the sword is made of bronze sandwiched between two off-white pieces of ivory carved to show clouds unleashing winds and snow.  The grip is covered with mother-of-pearl lashed securely into place with bronze wire.  The pommel of the weapon is a solid bronze globe with the snowflake lozenge of Auril etched into the bottom.

The full history of this blade and its brother have been well documented.  Roughly two hundred years ago, a wizard from Shannath named Obren the Left-Handed was hired to make a pair of swords for the glory of Auril.  Obren reluctantly did so, producing Alamion ("Frost Daddy") and Malamion ("Frost Baby") over a five year period.  After a dispute about Obren's fee, priests of Auril tried to take the sword from him by force.  The exact outcome of the battle is unclear, but Obren's swords did not end up in the hands of Auril's faithful.  Thirty years later, a warrior named Berdino in Procampur bragged that he had a blade that could kill demons in a single strike.  Berdino was found dead on the shore two tendays later, the victim of many poisoned crossbow bolts.

The new owner of Alamion was a vain, egotistical thief called Pellas the Fair.  Pellas had acquired Malamion, quite by accident, fourteen years earlier and strongly desired its brother when he learned of its existence.  Pellas held onto the swords until he died at the hands of a paladin named Garijon Renold of Torm.  Garijon found the blades invaluable in his battles against the fiery denizens of the outer planes and the two swords were passed on for generations from paladin to paladin.

Heleban of Ithmong, a paladin of Tyr, was the last warrior known to have used the swords.  His battles against slavers and pirates on the Sword Coast are believed to have brought him to an untimely end.

It has one drawback however, as it seems to fuel its power with the blood of its wearer.  Because of this, the wearer of the claw will often be sicker and more susceptible to poisons.

(Invocation)
Level: 2
Sphere: Combat
Range: Sight of Caster
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: 1/2
This spell creates a silver-hued, partially ethereal lance shaped in the form of an alicorn (a unicorn horn).  The spellcaster chooses a target and the alicorn lance instantaneously fires at it, inflicting 3d6 points of piercing damage, with a saving throw for half damage.  Although the alicorn lance dissipates after it strikes, it leaves a silvery radiance around the target that makes it easier to see and hit, giving it a -2 penalty to its AC for 3 rounds.~
@12140 = ~Armor (Conjuration) 
Level: 1
Range: Caster
Duration: 9 hours
Casting Time: 1 round 
Area of Effect: Caster 
Saving Throw: None 
By means of this spell, the wizard creates a magical field of force that serves as if it were scale mail armor (AC 6). It is cumulative with Dexterity and, in the case of fighter/mages, with the shield bonus. The armor spell does not hinder movement, adds no weight or encumbrance, nor does it prevent spellcasting. It lasts until successfully dispelled or until the duration runs out.

~
@12141 = ~Burning Hands (Alteration) 
Level: 1
Range: Caster
Duration: Instantaneous 
Casting Time: 1 
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: 1/2
When the wizard casts this spell, a jet of searing flame shoots from his fingertips. The flame jets are five feet in length and spread out in a horizontal arc of about 120 degrees in front of the wizard. Any creature in the area of effect suffers 1-3 hit points of damage, plus 2 points per level of experience of the spellcaster, to a maximum of 1-3 + 20 points of fire damage. If the target saves vs. spell, they only take half damage.
~
@12142 = ~Mirror Image (Illusion/Phantasm) 
Level: 2
Range: Caster
Duration: 3 rounds/level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 6-foot radius 
Saving Throw: None 
When a Mirror Image spell is invoked, the spellcaster causes two to eight duplicates of himself to come into being around him. These images do exactly what the wizard does. Since the spell causes a blurring and slight distortion when it is cast, it is impossible for opponents to be certain which ones are the illusions and which is the actual wizard. When an image is struck by a melee or missile attack, magical or otherwise, it disappears, but any other existing images remain intact until struck. The images shift from round to round so that an enemy must first hit every image before being able to hit the wizard.~
@12143 = ~Shadow Door (Illusion/Phantasm) 
Level: 5
Range: 10 yards 
Duration: 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 2 
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 
By means of this spell, the wizard creates the illusion of a door. The illusion also permits the wizard to appear to step through this "door" and disappear. In reality he has darted aside and can flee, totally invisible (as per the Improved Invisibility spell), for the spell duration. A true seeing spell, a gem of seeing, or similar magical means can discover the wizard. 
~
@12144 = ~Wraithform (Alteration, Illusion) 
Level: 3
Range: 0 
Duration: 2 rounds/level 
Casting Time: 1 
Area of Effect: The caster 
Saving Throw: None 
When this spell is cast, the wizard and all of his gear become insubstantial. The caster is subject only to magical or special attacks, including those by weapons of +1 or better, or by creatures otherwise able to affect those struck only by magical weapons.  The wizard also gains a 25% magic resistance.  While in wraith form the caster is unable to cast spells.
~
@12145 = ~Dispel Magic (Abjuration) 
Level: 3
Range: Sight of Caster
Duration: Instantaneous 
Casting Time: 3 
Area of Effect: 15-foot radius 
Saving Throw: None 
A Dispel Magic spell removes magical effects upon anyone within the area of effect. This includes the effects of spells, potions and magical items. It does not, however, affect magical items themselves.~
@12146 = ~Minor Globe of Invulnerability 
(Abjuration) 
Level: 4
Range: Caster
Duration: 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 4 
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None 
This spell creates an immobile, faintly shimmering magical sphere around the caster that prevents any 1st-, 2nd-, or 3rd-level spell effects from penetrating (i.e., the area of effect of any such spell does not include the area of the Minor Globe of Invulnerability). This includes innate abilities and effects from devices. However, any type of spell can be cast out of the magical sphere with no penalty. The globe can be brought down by a successful Dispel Magic spell.~
@12147 = ~Non-Detection (Abjuration) 
Level: 3
Range: Touch 
Duration: 7 turns/level
Casting Time: 3 
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None 
By casting this spell, the wizard makes the creature or object touched undetectable by divination spells such as Clairaudience, Clairvoyance, Locate Object, ESP, and detect spells. It also prevents spells that reveal a hidden or invisible (such as Detect Invisibility and Invisibility Purge) from working on the target.~
@12148 = ~Protection From Evil (Abjuration) 
Level: 1
Range: Touch 
Duration: 2 rounds/level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Creature touched 
Saving Throw: None 
When this spell is cast, it creates a magical barrier around the recipient at a distance of one foot. The barrier moves with the recipient and has two major effects: first, all attacks made by evil or evilly enchanted creatures against the protected creature receive a penalty of - 2 to each attack roll, and second, any saving throws caused by such attacks are made by the protected creature with a +2 bonus.~
@12149 = ~Protection From Normal Missiles 
(Abjuration) 
Level: 3
Range: Touch 
Duration: 1 turn/level 
Casting Time: 3 
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None 
This spell gives a target total invulnerability to hurled and projected missiles including arrows, axes, bolts, javelins, small stones, and spears. This spell does not provide protection from magical attacks such as Fireballs, Lightning Bolts, or Magic Missiles.~
@12150 = ~Protection from Petrification 
(Abjuration)
Level: 2
Range: Touch
Duration: 3 rounds/level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Target
Saving Throw: None
This spell grants the recipient immunity to all petrification attacks.  This includes basilisk and medusa gaze, cursed scrolls of petrification, etc.
~
@12151 = ~Resist Fear 
(Abjuration)
Level: 2
Range: Sight of Caster
Duration: 1 hour
Casting Time: 1 
Area of Effect: 30-foot radius
Saving Throw: Special 
This mage spell instills courage in the spell's recipients, raising their morale to maximum. The recipients' morale will gradually reset to normal as the duration runs out. If the recipients are under the effects of magical fear, the effect is negated.~
@12152 = ~Flame Arrow (Conjuration/Summoning) 
Level: 3
Range: Sight of Caster
Duration: 1 round 
Casting Time: 3 
Area of Effect: Special

Thus, a 10th-level fighter could be charmed, but an ogre could not. The person receives a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effect.  If the spell recipient fails his saving throw, he regards the caster as a trusted friend and ally to be heeded and protected.  The caster may give him orders, and the charmed individual will carry them out as quickly as possible.
If the caster harms, or attempts to harm, the charmed person by some overt action, or if a dispel magic spell is successfully cast upon the charmed person, the charm spell is broken.  If two or more charm effects simultaneously affect a creature, the most recent charm takes precedence.  Note that the subject has full memory of the events that took place while he was charmed. Also note that you cannot have a charmed creature leave the area where he was charmed.~

Thus, the creature will fight enemies of the caster, even former allies. The spell is limited in the same manner as Charm Person Spell. The spell can affect any bipedal human, demihuman, or humanoid of man-size or smaller, such as dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans, lizard men, orcs, troglodytes, and others.

Thus, a 10th-level fighter could be held, while an ogre could not. The effect selects the enemies closest to the target and holds them. Enemies making their saving throws are totally unaffected by the spell. Undead creatures cannot be held. Held creatures cannot move or speak, but they remain aware of events around them and can use abilities not requiring motion or speech. Being held does not prevent the worsening of the subject's condition due to wounds, disease, or poison.~

A streak flashes from the pointing digit and, unless it impacts upon a material body or solid barrier prior to attaining the prescribed range, blossoms into the fireball (an early impact results in an early detonation), delivering damage proportional to the level of the wizard who cast it: 1-6 points of damage for each level of the spellcaster (up to a maximum of 10-60).

Duration: 2 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 4 
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None 
When the priest casts a Sanctuary spell, it causes all of his opponents to ignore his existence; as if he is invisible.  While protected by this spell, the subject cannot take direct offensive action without breaking the spell, but may use non-attack spells or otherwise act in any way that does not violate the prohibition against offensive action. This allows a warded priest to heal wounds, for example, or to bless himself.  He cannot cast spells on other creatures without ending the spell.

Level: 3
Sphere: Weather 
Range: Sight of Caster
Duration: 1 turn/level 
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Sight of Caster
Saving Throw: 1/2
When a Call Lightning spell is cast, it must be cast outside, otherwise it will not work and the spell is wasted. The caster is able to call down bolts of lightning. The caster can call down one bolt per turn.  The spell has a duration of one turn per caster level. Each bolt causes 2d8 points of electrical damage, plus an additional 1d8 points for each of the caster's experience levels. Thus, a 4th-level caster calls down a 6d8 bolt (2d8 + 4d8).

Furthermore, it raises their attack dice rolls by +1. The caster determines at what range (up to 60 yards) he will cast the spell. At the instant the spell is completed, it affects all creatures in a 50-foot cube centered on the point selected by the caster (thus, affected creatures leaving the area are still subject to the spell's effect; those entering the area after the casting is completed are not).

@12217 = ~Chant (Conjuration/Summoning) 
Level: 2
Sphere: Combat

Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 1 round 
Area of Effect: 30-foot radius

Multiple Chants are not cumulative.  This spell requires a moderate amount of concentration by the caster, so the priest cannot cast any spells for the Chant's duration, and his movement is slowed by half.~

Level: 4
Sphere: Elemental (Fire) 
Range: Visual range of caster

'The wall of fire must be cast so that it is vertical with respect to the caster.  The wall inflicts 4d4 points of damage, plus 1 point of damage per level of the spellcaster, to any creature passing through it. Creatures especially subject to fire may take additional damage, and undead always take twice normal damage. Note that attempting to directly catch moving creatures with a newly created wall of fire is difficult; a successful saving throw enables the creature to avoid the wall, while its rate and direction of movement determine which

@12222 = ~Know Alignment (Divination) 
Level: 2
Sphere: Divination 
Range: Sight of Caster
Duration: 1 turn 
Casting time: 1 round 
Area of Effect: 1 creature 
Saving Throw: Neg. 
A Know Alignment spell enables the priest to read the aura of a creature.  If the creature rolls a successful saving throw vs. spell, the caster learns nothing about that particular creature from the casting.  Evil creatures will glow red, neutrals blue, and friendly creatures will glow green for a brief period.~
@12223 = ~Charm Person or Mammal 
(Enchantment/Charm) 
Level: 2
Sphere: Animal 
Range: Sight of Caster
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 5 
Area of Effect: 1 person or mammal 
Saving Throw: Neg. 
This spell affects any single person or mammal it is cast upon.  The term "person" includes any bipedal human, demihuman, or humanoid of man-size or smaller, such as dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans, lizard men, orcs, troglodytes, and others.
Thus, a 10th-level fighter could be charmed, but an ogre could not.  The person receives a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effect.  If the save is failed, the victim regards the caster as a trusted friend and ally to be heeded and protected.  The caster may give him orders, and the charmed individual will carry them out without question.
If the caster harms, or attempts to harm, the charmed person by some overt action, or if a dispel magic spell is successfully cast upon the charmed person, the Charm Person spell is broken.  If two or more charm effects simultaneously affect a creature, the most recent charm takes precedence. Note that the subject has full memory of the events that took place while he was charmed.  No charmed creatures may leave the area or attack non-hostile targets.~

Level: 3
Sphere: Animal 
Range: Sight of Caster
Duration: 2 rounds/level 
Casting Time: 5 
Area of Effect: 20-foot radius
Saving Throw: Neg. 
This spell holds animals rigidly immobile.  Only normal and giant-sized animals are affected by this spell.  Strange monsters such as wyverns and carrion crawlers do not count as animals.  The effect is centered on a point selected by the caster, and 1-4 animals within 20 feet of the target point are affected.  Those who succeed on their saving throws are unaffected by the spell.  Being held does not prevent the worsening of the subject's condition due to wounds, disease, or poison.~
@12315 = ~Hold Person (Enchantment/Charm)
Level: 2
Sphere: Charm
Range: Sight of Caster
Duration: 2 rounds/level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Neg.
This spell holds 1-4 humans, demihumans, or humanoid creatures immobile for five rounds or longer. The Hold Person spell affects any bipedal human, demihuman, or humanoid of man size or smaller, including dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans, lizard men, orcs, troglodytes, and others. Thus, a 10th-level fighter could be held, while an ogre could not. The effect selects the enemies closest to the target and holds them. Enemies making their saving throws are totally unaffected by the spell. Undead creatures cannot be held. Held creatures cannot move or speak, but they remain aware of events around them and can use abilities not requiring motion or speech. Being held does not prevent the worsening of the subject's condition due to wounds, disease, or poison.~

Level: 3
Sphere: Chaos 
Range: Sight of Caster
Duration: 1 turn 
Casting Time: 5 
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

@12317 = ~Magical Stone (Enchantment) 
Level: 1
Sphere: Combat 
Range: Sight of Caster
Duration: Special 
Casting Time: 4 
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 
By using this spell, the priest can temporarily enchant a small pebble, which is then hurled or slung at an opponent.  The stone deals 3-12 damage to whomever it hits; if the creature is an undead creature it does 6-24 hit points of damage.  The stone is considered a +1 weapon for determining if a creature can be struck (those struck only by magical weapons, for instance), although it does not have an attack or damage bonus.~
@12318 = ~Flame Blade (Evocation) 
Level: 2
Sphere: Elemental (Fire) 
Range: Caster
Duration: 4 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 4 
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None 
With this spell, the caster causes a blazing ray of red-hot fire to spring forth from his hand. This blade-like ray is wielded as if it were a scimitar. If the caster successfully hits with the Flame Blade in melee combat, the creature struck suffers 1d4 + 4 points of damage, with a damage bonus of +2 (i.e., 7-10 points) if the creature is undead or is especially vulnerable to fire. If the creature is protected from fire, the damage inflicted is reduced by 2 (i.e., 1d4 + 2 points). Fire dwellers and those using fire as an innate attack form suffer no damage from the spell. However, it is not a magical weapon in the normal sense of the term, so creatures (other than undead) struck only by magical weapons are not harmed by it. The Flame Blade uses the scimitar proficiency.

Sphere: Combat 
Range: Sight of Caster
Duration: Instantaneous 
Casting Time: 8 
Area of Effect: 5-foot radius

Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None
By calling upon his deity, the caster of a Spiritual Hammer spell brings into existence a magical hammer which may be used as a weapon for the duration of the spell.  The hammer strikes as a magical weapon with a bonus of +1 for every six experience levels (or fraction) of the spellcaster, up to a total of +3 to the attack roll and +3 to the damage roll for a 13th-level caster.  The base damage inflicted when it scores a hit is exactly the same as a normal war hammer, 2-5.~

Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 1 
Area of Effect: 1 creature

When this spell is placed upon a poisoned individual, it slows the effects of venom.  This spell does not neutralize the poison, just slows it down enough so you can get real healing at a temple or from your party's priest.~

Level: 4
Sphere: Healing 
Range: Touch 
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 7

Raise Dead will not work on someone killed by a Death Spell, Finger of Death, Destruction, or Disintegrate.

Note that when this spell is inscribed on a scroll, its power is diminished.  A scroll of Raise Dead may not work unless invoked at the place where the target died.

Area of Effect: 5 Berries
Saving Throw: None

@13136 = ~History of Amn:  

Amn has the good fortune to have abundant natural resources; some would say Amn is the richest land on the continent. This has worked in Amn's favor for generations, because even if they were conquered, the new masters would be gentle, looking to gain wealth from the land, rather than to put it to the torch. 

Amn has been a center of trade and commerce for as long as anyone can remember. Oral traditions handed down from father to son tend to support the theory that Amn has been a trade center for at least 800 years. Unfortunately, written records are difficult to find and often incomplete. It would seem the typical Amnish citizen was too busy trying to fill their coffers to write down events of the day. 

Amn has always been more interested in the present and the future than the past, and this makes an accurate history difficult. The best records, the business papers of the oldest trading companies, are jealously guarded.  The fear of revealing "trade secrets" is stronger than the call of history, so the average citizen knows very little about Amn's past. 

It appears that the Amn of 100 years ago was very much like the Calimshan of today.  Each major city was basically an independent entity, banding together for defense when necessary, and fighting for control of territory and profitable trade routes the rest of the time.  A particularly brutal trade war began 24 years ago, with each city exacting prohibitive tariffs on goods imported from the others. The trade war escalated, and city troops began to raid caravans sponsored by other cities. In a matter of months commerce was brought to a halt, a number of cities were under siege, and war threatened to engulf the entire region. 

Into the breach stepped a young merchant named Thayze Selemchant. Thayze was smart, charismatic, and very well connected (the Selemchant trading house was one of the oldest and richest in Athkatla.) He secretly contacted representatives of the five other richest merchant houses in Amn, and started to plan. 

The first part of the plan involved the careful sprinkling of rumors about outside threats.  One involved a pirate invasion from the Nelanther, another was about a massing of orcs just on the other side of the Cloud Peaks. Thayze even started a rumor about an elf army in the Forest of Tethir, ready to pounce on a divided Amn.  None of the rumors were true, but they began to turn people's thoughts toward unity, not war. 

Thayze knew that if he and the other members of his council were to take control of Amn, they would need broad-based popular support. Tensions between cities and merchant houses were still high, so to get that support, Selemchant and the others agreed to drop their family names and never use them again. 

When news of a "Council of Six" spread throughout the land, many people accepted their rule.  A group that would unite Amn under one rule, governing for the benefit of all instead of one city or trading company over another, was indeed a welcome change.  The Council raised an army (at great personal expense) to quell the few pockets of resistance that remained, and have been in total control of Amn for the past 22 years.

@13137 = ~History of Calimshan:

Calimshan is older than either of the other Empires of the Sands, first settled over 7,000 years ago by the Djen, a humanoid race from the Elemental Plane of Air. These Djen were known to be very magical, and during the course of their rule they developed many new spells previously not available in the Plane of Air.

The Djen prospered for over 1,000 years in Calimshan, but their reign was ended by an invasion of creatures and minions from the Plane of Fire.  Some say this is where the bitter hatred between djinni and efreeti started, though others contend this was just a result of a hatred that was already there.  Whatever the cause, the battle was long and bloody, and took over 100 years to complete. The Djen finally routed the attackers, but were greatly weakened in the attempt. They slowly declined, and the last mention of the Djen is just under 6,000 years old.

For the next 4,000 years Calimshan was dominated by nomadic tribes of humans. Tribes from various places - Chult, the Shaar, The Shining Plains, Chondath, even Amn and Cormyr - took turns dominating, only to be conquered by the next, nearly identical tribe.

Slowly, the nomadic nature of Calimshan began to change.  As explorers and traders from Amn, Waterdeep, and Cormyr discovered the wonders of the area, some tribes began to settle down and develop new means of support, like fishing, farming, or trading. These communities began to band together for mutual protection, and soon a civilization was born.  It was only 1,300 years ago that the Shoon Empire (now called Iltkazar) came into being.

The Shoons were a grand and glorious empire, and their excesses were the foundation of Calishite snobbery today. They grew wise and powerful in the ways of magic, and ships and caravans bearing the Shoon flag traveled across the Forgotten Realms.  Shoon himself, a particularly powerful mage, created a book of great power during this time called the Tome of the Unicorn.  The exact location of the Tome has been lost in time, but since the book is 2' by 3' and made of pure metal, it is likely to still be around... somewhere.

900 years ago the Shoon empire abruptly vanished. A great magical upheaval was suspected at first, but learned mages of other lands dispute the claim.   A force that great, they say, would have disturbed magical powers and beings throughout the Realms, and that didn't happen.  Sages who have studied the Shoon at great length have reached no definite conclusions, but the most popular theories today center around a plague or disease that decimated the population.

Today, the Shoon impact on Calimshan is still great. The grandeur of that empire is responsible, more than anything else, for the strong national character of Calimshan today. The ruins of the Shoon's greatest city, Monrativi Teshy Mir, can still be found in the wilderness to the west of the edge of the Forest of Mir (see below for more on Monrativi Teshy Mir).

Since the fall of Shoon, no force or people has risen to solely dominate the land.  There are a half dozen or so major cities, each of which exerts its power over its own area.  About 170 years ago, a man in Calimport amassed a large army and declared himself "Pasha" over the land.  Before that army could march, however, the representatives of each major city met and agreed to recognize the Pasha's authority in limited areas, and to pay a small tribute to him; enough to pay for the works the Pasha was expected to do.  The oldest son of each Pasha inherits the title; if there is no son, the mayors of each large city select a new one.  The current Pasha, Rashid Djenispool, has ruled for over 18 years, and is the grandson of a pasha elected by the mayors of Calimshan 44 years ago. ~
@13138 = ~History of Cormyr:  

Cormyr dates its years from the founding of House Obarskyr 1,342 years ago, the first of the noble houses and the line of its kings.  For the bulk of this time, Cormyr was little more than a single city (Suzail) and a few fortified outposts.  At times the monarch was forced by rebellion and intrigue to rule from those outposts instead of from the throne.  King Azoun is the fourth of his name and the 71st of his line. 

The land has been officially at peace for many years - since Rhigaerd overthrew the last of the border raiders.  However, Cormyrean armies have taken part in many actions in nearby regions, recently mustering its forces to face Gondegal, the rebel of Arabel; to occupy Tilverton on the marches of the Dalelands; and to lead a crusade against the great Tuigan horde invading from the east.  One wit has noted that "Yes, the land is at peace, but the army has to keep busy."  In addition to pursuing major actions, Cormyrean patrols often skirmish with bandits on the roads in the north and west, and are at present battling orcs and other creatures north and east of Cormyr in Tilver's Gap and Shadow Gap.  Both of these areas are threatened by raiders who will menace Cormyr itself if they ever overrun Tilverton.  Cormyr has built a fortress, Castle Crag, to defend the kingdom from attacks from that quarter, and maintains the High Horn to protect against attacks from the West. ~
@13139 = ~History of Dambrath:

The nation of Dambrath was formed out of a barbarian kingdom almost a half-millennium ago by a powerful alliance of priestesses of Loviatar and the drow from the city of T'lindhet.

In 211 DR, fleeing from the destruction of the homeland by the then-great kingdoms of Unther and Mulhorand, four tribes of barbarians entered Dambrath.  They found a coast where the dolphins danced and plains where the grass was long.  They roamed from the borders of the Walls of Halruaa as far east as the current borders of Estagund.  They soon became known as the Arkaiun, or people of the wind.

In 545 DR a great warchief, Reinhar, arose to lead the tribes.  The halflings of Luiren were quickly enslaved, and several of the coastal cities of Durpar were captured or razed.  Estagund fell to his rule, and  eventually Reinhar turned his attention to Halruaa.

An army of 40,000 horsemen and a fleet of 50 ships mounted a coordinated attack, and even though Reinhar was able to get beyond the Walls of Halruaa and occupy the cities of Mithel, Galdel, and Zalsuu, their magics proved to be more than a match for the invaders.  Reinhar was finally defeated in a great battle at Sulaziir by the archmage Mycontil and his troop of wizards.

Reinhar's son, Reinhar II, took command of the army and set out on a two month overland retreat.  He arrived home with a thousand surviving fighting men and no shaman.  Reinhar II proved to be as good a ruler in defeat as his father was in war.  He consolidated his forces and pulled home almost all of his troops, as he knew that the defeat made them tempting prey for raiders and encroaching monsters.  This action allowed for the safe development of his peoples.

By the time the ninth Reinhar was king in 802 DR, the Arkaiuns were fat and lazy.  Reinhar IX, or Reinhar the Foolish as he is more commonly known, insisted on expanding his nation to gain more gold to finance his military campaigns.  He ordered the mining of many rich lodes of silver and electrum in the Gnollwatch mountains, but before his plans of expansion could begin, the miners encountered the drow of T'lindher.  The drow were outraged and began a steady series of raids and attacks on the Arkaiun strongholds.  Whole villages were destroyed overnight, and no trace of the invaders could be found.

Reinhar IX committed the foolhardy action of attacking the drow in retaliation.  While the Arkaiuns managed to get a force into the drow city, this action only succeeded in uniting the normally chaotic drow.  For once, the full power of a drow city was turned against an enemy.

The battle quickly moved back to the surface.  Reinhar's raiders were wiped out, leaving Reinhar with only a small portion of his original military.  This was not enough for the drow, who demanded total enslavement of the entire surface nation.  The Arkaiuns resisted valiantly, and the war went on for three decades at tremendous cost in life to both sides.

Finally, the drow had the Arkaiun forces cornered at Malduir.  Almost without hope, the defenders were overjoyed when a group of half-elven pilgrims appeared on the scene.  The high priestess, Cathtyr Shintar, offered the aid of her clerics to help defend the city, and Reinhar took this to be an omen from the gods.  A priestess was placed with almost every company.

Within a tenday the drow struck.  The priestesses did indeed prove to be of great aid, but to the drow.  Every priestess turned on the Arkaiuns, and Cathtyr herself slew Reinhar.  The drow were still weakened by the battle, and only the presence of the priestesses enabled them to win.  Cathtyr, realizing the unique advantage she possessed, made a deal that even the suspicious drow embraced.  Her priestesses would rule the land, and in exchange they would provide access to the surface for the drow, trading weapons, slaves, and supplies.

The drow were delighted with this brazen offer from a surface dweller.   Reinhar had been slain and the insult avenged, and after 30 years of war the drow were not particularly interested in Dambrath.  They did insist, however, on taking the best captured males as slaves.  Cathtyr quickly agreed to this, seeing the males as an obstacle to her own power.

Cathtyr ruled for 205 years.  She fulfilled her promise to make Dambrath, or "The Nation of Pain," a bastion of evil in the Realms.  In her time, Cathtyr saw the priesthood of Loviatar expand to thousands, and faith in the Beastlords previously worshiped by the Arkaiuns was nearly eradicated.  Many of the Arkaiuns were able to escape their new mistresses and flee to the Swagdar.  There they resumed their almost forgotten nomadic life.

The priestesses of Loviatar continued to enjoy good relations with the drow, and some even took mates, creating a race of drow half-elves.  These dark half-elves became known as the Crintri, or "noble ones."  Most are priestesses of Loviatar, though many are mages as well.  They consolidated their power, learning much of the area from the Shebali, or "lower ones," as the Arkaiuns are now called.  The capital of Dambrath was established at Cathtyr, built after Cathtyr's passing and named in her honor.  Her death came at the hands of her daughter, Filina, who had grown tired of waiting for her mother to die.  Filina ruled for only five years, however, before her own daughter, Cathakay, assumed the throne in the same fashion.  Cathakay ruled for 54 years, eventually falling in battle against a gold dragon.  She died childless, and her niece Melanith assumed the throne.

Melanith faced an increasing population, and unrest among males who longed for a return to their prestige of old.  Melanith did not return their previous status, but she did make use of them.  Fearing that the great nations of Mulhorand and Unther might rise again, she decided that mundane tasks, such as the defense of the kingdom, would be handled by men.  She was the first to name a male to the post of warchief.  Sadalar, a Crintri, became the queen's consort.  His term as warchief was characterized by widespread bribery and corruption.  He was, however, responsible for getting many privileges returned to the Arkaiuns.  After Melanith's rule,  the Shebali were considered second class citizens, rather than slaves.

Though males were granted more power during her rule, Melanith also solidified the split between the sexes.  While the rulers of Dambarth had been females for over two centuries, it was more because of competence than gender.  Melanith, however, decreed that men could have no authority except over other men.  The female-led hierarchy of Loviatar was quick to back this move.

Many of the bravest and best men of the kingdom perished in raids on Estagund, Durpar, the bandit tribes of Veldorn, and against the gnolls that had returned to the Gnollwatch Mountains.  Some even fought at the side of the drow in their battle with the svirfneblin city of Aventine.  The deep gnomes were destroyed, but so were the Shebali.  The drow and the Crintri were largely unharmed, and for their aid, the Crintri were rewarded with a number of drow males to breed in to their race.  Melanith took a drow male as her consort to replace Sadalar, who had perished in the conflict.  The drow, Nym Inthigg, fathered three daughters and a son.  It was at this time that Melantih began the isolationist policy that Dambrath still follows today.

Melanith ruled for 156 years; her daughter Ausitil for 125.  The current queen of Dambrath is Yenandra; she is known there as the "Pirate Queen," for she has sailed as far south as Zakhara on pillaging raids.  Yenandra has been ruling for 71 years, and is beginning to show signs of age.  She has three daughters as well, named Luatharyn, Meltruil, and Hasafir.  While she does remain extremely popular, especially to the Crintri, the children of leaders in this land are not known to patiently wait their turn.~
@13140 = ~History of Durpar and Var the Golden:

Durpar and Var the Golden share a common history.  Over three-thousand years ago, these countries were both subject to the great kingdom of Raurin.  When Raurin fell in -2488DR, the countries of Durpar and Var barely survived the destruction.

Rioting, mass destruction, and hatred of nobility were rampant, and the two countries descended into barbarism for over two millennia.  Finally, after most of the barbarian tribes were wiped out by the great empire of Mulhorand, a leader emerged.  Satama, a mere trader, experienced a divine revelation and formulated a new philosophy  All things in the world were connected, were part of a single creation spirit, and all of the gods of the Realms were merely parts of the same entity.  Soon all the Shining Lands embraced the teachings of Satama, and the seeds of civilization were laid in what came to be known as the Lands of the One.

Since the Lands of the One had many natural resources, trade with Mulhorand and Luiren became a way of life.  Merchants were honored above all.  In time, the Maharajah of Durpar and the Rajah of Var were replaced with a Council of Merchants.  During this time the land suffered occasional raiding attacks from the horsewomen of Dambrath, and had many skirmishes with the neighboring countries of Estagund and Ulgarth.

In 1023 DR, after an armed peace had been worked out with Ulgarth, the Council of Merchants decided that something needed to done about the raiders from Estagund who were hurting trade with other countries.  War was an inconvenience, but interrupting trade was life-threatening.

Jeradeem, the richest merchant in the lands, was given power to negotiate a settlement.  During these negotiations he proved, at least in the eyes of the Durparians, that he was indeed the master trader he seemed.  Estagund had just tried a foolish invasion of Dambrath.  The vengeful female leaders of that land wiped out nearly every able-bodied fighting man they sent.  The monsters of Veldorn were causing problems, and Estagund was going through a famine.

It was here that Jeradeem showed his fine merchant's instincts.  He could not pass up such an advantage, and began bargaining the most outrageous trade of all time.  He met with the leaders of Estagund, a fearful king and his nobles, and explained the advantages of Durparian life and the philosophy of the Adama, the oneness of all things.  He bargained for days until finally the king made the trade.  He purchased the whole of Estagund for the countries of Durpar and Var at the price of 24 gems.  He also promised protection, and help for their integration into the Durparian way of life.  Thus were formed the Shining Lands.

Within a hundred years, the three countries shared a common way of life, and with the added strength and resources of Estagund, Durparian merchants increased their trading range.  They roamed as far east as Kara-Tur, as far north as the Sea of Fallen Stars, and west to Dambrath and Halruaa.  At the present time, with the newly discovered lands of Maztica and Zakhara beckoning, the future looks bright.~
@13141 = ~History of Estagund:

Estagund history follows a different path than those of Durpar and Var.  The Gunders were conquered in 551 DR by Reinhar I, warchief of the Arkaiuns of Dambrath.  Estagund regained its independence when Reinhar was slain by the Halruaan archmage Mycontil, though the country soon degenerated into a group of small independent city states.

Skirmishes with Var, and between the city-states, continued for several centuries until a king once again united the country.  King Bornial was a skilled ruler, and under him Estagund began to prosper.  His descendants did not share his wisdom, and in 1053 DR, King Selkarin more than illustrated this.  He had failed to conquer Durpar, and Veldorn resisted his challenges.  An avowed misogynist, Selkarin turned his attentions to the matriarchy of Dambrath.  He led a large fleet to attack Dambrath, taking extreme losses, including his own life.  Selkarin died childless, so his brother Seltarir was crowned King.  The new ruler faced a country with most of its fighting men gone, and an unforeseen problem: famine.  The famine was caused by a blight that wiped out nearly all the year's crops in Estagund.  This made him eager for a deal posed by the Durparian merchant Jeradeem, and in a legendary trade the entire country of Estagund was sold.  Contrary to popular rumor, Seltarir did not trade away the country for 24 pearls.  In actuality he received diamonds worth almost a million gold pieces.  The sudden wealth gave him an instant seat on the Council of Merchants, so he retained a measure of rule in addition to his fortune.  Chaka Seltarir is still the richest chaka in Estagund to this day.  In the years that followed, the Gunders began rebuilding their lives under their new circumstance, and now they compete on equal footing with the merchants of Durpar and Var. ~
@13142 = ~History of Gondegal the Lost King:  

Arabel, long under the dominion of Cormyr, for a time became the center of a swordsman's empire.  This swordsman was Gondegal, the Lost King, who in the Year of the Dragon (1352 DR) attempted to carve a kingdom for himself centered on Arabel.  It was to extend north to the Desertsmouth Mountains; south and west of Wyvernwater and the farms outlying from Eveningstar; and east to Tilver's Gap and the mountain passes. 

In the years following, people would say that Gondegal's reach was no longer than his blade.  He could not hold any of the territory against the might of Cormyr, Sembia, Daggerdale, Tilverton, and several of the other Dales -all of whom he drew the blood and ire of in the making of his throne.  

Gondegal ruled for less than a season, though he reigned officially for scarcely eight days.  The remainder of his rule was spent fighting here and there against one foe or another in the lands he claimed.  His troops were largely mercenary, and his treasury of seized goods was small and soon gone.  One night Gondegal's force simply melted away before the advancing troops of Cormyr, and was gone.  King Azoun IV retook Arabel on that morn without wetting a blade. 

No one has ever found the body of Gondegal; he is known to have fled north and then east via Teshwave, but then his fate becomes a matter of conflicting rumor and legend.  Some believe he still lives with a score or more of loyal followers, keeping court in the wilds somewhere, a careful and ruthless bandit who takes care that none survive his attacks to carry tales anywhere.  When entire caravans vanish at times anywhere between the High Dale and far-off Impiltur, he is blamed by talk in the taverns.  

Gondegal was said to be a tall, gray-haired warrior of considerable personal skill and intelligence.  His badge was a gray wolf's head, face on, with red eyes.  Caravan guards often warn merchants to beef up the escort on a particular caravan, "else thy gold'll soon be gilding Gondegal's throne."  Gondegal was an impeccable swordsman and somewhat chaotic in his self professed neutral alignment.  If he does indeed yet live, the magic or treasure he carries, and who his allies might be, are all unknown.

Gondegal's reign had a great influence on the King of Cormyr, at that time in his second decade of rule.  Not only was Azoun forced to put down an effective rebellion in his own country, he was forced to pay more attention to matters outside Suzail, to become the ruler of a nation as opposed to a city-state.  Further, the bloodless assault on Arabel was Azoun's first true experience at the head of his army, and the joy of "freeing" the people of Arabel is one that remains with him.

@13143 = ~History of Halruaa:

Halruaa was settled centuries ago by wizards fleeing the Phaerimm in what was to become the Anauroch desert.  The first wizards came in unique flying ships invented by the Netheril, and found a beautiful and rich country settled only by shepherds and large herds of aurochs and wild rothe.  It was here that the wizards decided to make a stand, should the Phaerimm follow.  The Phaerimm never did, but Halruaa has had to defend itself from attacks by all of its neighbors since then.

Over the centuries Dambrath has attacked and raided Halruaa's ports and borders multiple times.  Once, led by a magic resistant barbarian, the Dambraii occupied all of the country south of Lake Halruaa.  They were defeated in battle by the great archmage Mycontil, who slew their barbarian leader.  Forty-thousand Dambraii attacked, and were stopped by 500 Halruaans.  More than 200 Halruaan wizards, including Mycontil, died in the battle.

The last attack upon Halruaa was less than 100 years ago, through the Telath Pass by the power hungry king of Lapaliiya.  He had allied with bandits from the wastes, though this time the Halruaans were able to field a larger force, including fighting men as well as wizards in their skyships.  The attackers were easily routed.

Halruaa also suffered through a civil war about five centuries ago, when a number of mages advocated beginning new experiments in magic, ones which even the Netheril didn't approve of.  The renegades were driven from the region, but went on to found the land of Thay, or so it is said in Halruaa.

Since then, Halruaa has been at peace (they have had no declared wars), though it still suffers raids from Dambraii pirates, bandits of the wastes, savages from the Mhair Jungles, and any other pirate, raider, or hungry wizard who thinks that magic and wealth grow on trees in Halruaa.

This constant raiding has made the Halruaans very defensive, warlike and traditional.  The people say that since wizards have always led them, wizards always will.  ~
@13144 = ~History of Luiren, Land of the Halflings: 

The halflings of Luiren claim that it is the original homeland of halflings in the Realms.  Although other halflings may disagree with this, it is true that Luiren was settled hundreds, perhaps thousands, of years ago.  

Luiren's history is one of conquerors and subjugation.  Throughout the centuries the halflings have been conquered by the barbarians who used to inhabit Dambrath, by the kingdom of Estagund, and even once by the monsters of Beldorn.  In every case, the invaders were eventually defeated because they made the mistake of underestimating the halflings due to their small stature.  A good bit of mischief, mayhem, and general trouble-making by the halflings also helped end the occupations.

Currently, Luiren is enjoying unprecedented prosperity.  The halflings are currently taking advantage of their relationship with the nation of Durpar; their biggest customer and greatest competitor.  Also, through these close ties with Durpar, Luiren has protected itself against another Dambraii invasion.  The rulers of Dambrath must know that if they begin to expand to the east, they will arouse the ire of Durpar, as well as Var and Esagund.  The threat of a trade embargo and/or military consequences have kept this aggressive nation away from the Luireners.  ~
@13145 = ~History of Sembia:

The land of Sembia was settled by humans coming to the Sea of Fallen Stars from the south, and was originally chosen for its stands of huge, high-quality iliyr-wood timber so prized in shipbuilding.  However, as the forests were cleared over the years, the treecutters came into increasing conflict with elves who feared the loss of their entire wood.  This would undoubtedly have occurred, had not the hastily gathered mercenary troops of the fledgling land been defeated by the elves at Singing Arrows (884 DR).  This battle convinced distant Chondath to abandon its holdings in the region and allow the immigrant Sembians to establish their independence (though as little more than a collection of rival city-states, much like the Moonsea or Vast of today).  It also set the stage for the appearance of the Raven.

The young country grew strong as farms prospered in the newly cleared lands.  Craftsmen arrived from the south to take advantage of this chance to acquire land and wealth, bringing their trades with them.  Rauthauvyr the Raven unified the city-states and towns in the face of the continuing "elven menace," and insisted on maintaining a standing army, which he kept in practice by policing Sembia's borders and improving its roads.  At this time (913 DR), Sembia became as a true nation.

The Moonsea's (Dragon Sea's) mineral wealth was discovered by humankind at about this time, and pressure began to grow for a trade road through the elven woods to make Sembia the world's gateway to all these riches.  The Raven went alone as an envoy to the Elven Court.  There, he asked the elders of their Council to approve a road, open to humans, linking Sembia to the shores of the Dragon Sea (an earlier road had been destroyed during the conflict and was now overgrown).  Raven proposed that the elves choose the route and retain control of it and the woods around it, so that no woodcutting or human settlement would occur.  The elves had earlier made similar arrangements with the Dalesmen and had no difficulty with the concept of such an agreement.  However, the inhabitants of Velarsdale (now Harrowdale) refused the proposal, not wanting or needing such a road at that time (curious, since later a ruler of Harrowdale commissioned the disastrous Halfaxe Trail). The elves, not wishing to offend long-time allies, refused Raven's request.

Rebuffed, the Raven then threatened to exterminate the isolated elves in Amothoi, the last embattled remnant of the elves in Sembia, if the Elven Court did not cooperate.  If the road was built, however, they would be free to trade, or not trade, as they wished.  The elves agreed under this pressure, and Sembia's financial future was secured. Hillsfar, on the shores of the Dragon Sea, became a commercial meeting ground between humankind and elves, as did Elventree.  The route the elves chose ran past the base of the Standing Stone as a reminder of earlier, less-hostile dealings between humans and elves.  Over the years the elves of Amothoi came north to join their brethren or slipped away to seek Evermeet, leaving their wood to gradually disappear.

Sembia grew rich under merchant leaders of increasing wisdom, such as Saer (for whom Saerb was named) and Selgar (for whom Chancelgaunt was renamed as Selgaunt).  Before his death, Rauthauvyr the Raven saw that these merchants had a strong standing council of merchant elders to advise them and to ensure that no ruler could hold onto power by force of arms.  Then this farsighted man, creator of a nation, now half-blind and infirm from old war wounds, rode north into the elven woods and disappeared.  None know what happened to him or where his bones lie, save perhaps some few elder elves. ~
@13146 = ~History of Shadowdale - The Fall of Azmaer, Last Drow Marshal of the Twisted Tower:

The drow rule of Shadowdale lasted until the early 900s Dale Reckoning, when the increased human population in the area brought the dark elves into conflict with their now more numerous neighbors.  The humans were the Dalesmen who a millennium earlier had crossed the Dragon Reach and made peace with the elves of Myth Drannor, settling at the borders of the great woods that was the elven home.  The drow soon found themselves under continual attack, and most of those who held overground settlements retreated back below.  The last powerful drow leader was Azmaer, the marshal of the Twisted Tower in its last drow-held days.  Azmaer oversaw the last retreat of the drow holdings in the face of a human uprising, and held the citadel against a year-long siege.  With supplies and slaves brought up from the Underdark directly into the tower, the drow could have conceivably held out forever; however, a human slave (family histories in the Dales indicate a number of possible individuals) poisoned the well in the Tower and the citadel was easily overrun.  Azmaer's body was not found among the dead, leading some to believe that he escaped back into the depths to rejoin his people.  Noting the fact that he would have had to explain to his matriarch how he lost Shadowdale, it is much more likely that, should Azmaer have survived, he went into voluntary exile, hiding from both human and drow.  Given that this occurred only 400 years ago, it is certainly possible that Azmaer still lives. ~
@13147 = ~History of Shadowdale - Ashaba Becomes First Lord of Shadowdale:

Upon taking the Twisted Tower and removing the drowish yoke from the people, the Dalesmen had fully established the Dale of Shadowdale, with its seat of power in the tower itself.  Its first lord was a water wizard who had aided in the final attack;  Ashaba, who was great in age when he ascended, and ruled peacefully for 40 years thereafter.  It is said that Ashaba realized he was dying and turned himself to water, merging with the river.  Since that time, the river, the ford, and the Twisted Tower all bear his name.  Before passing on, Ashaba chose one of his trusted lieutenants as the new lord of Shadowdale.  Presented to the people of the Dale, he was made the new lord by acclamation.  In an additional honor, the pendant worn by Ashaba was thereafter recognized as a symbol of the lordship in the Dalelands, and was possessed by each of the successive lords following.~
@13148 = ~History of Shadowdale -  Joadath and the Tyrist Massacre: 

The past hundred years have been an example of the best and worst of the lords of Shadowdale.  All have been nonnative to the Dalelands, though all made the land their home.  A century ago the lord of the Dales was one Joadath, a stiff-necked agnostic who denied the power of any god, good or evil, and used force to back up his beliefs.  During this time there was a great deal of religious persecution, including a massacre of Tyrists on Watcher's Knoll.  Joadath was eventually killed by a beast of the nether planes summoned by parties unknown, which then proceeded to rampage through the Dale.  The beast was killed and Shadowdale rescued by the spellcasters Aumry and Sylune.  Aumry was proclaimed lord by acclamation. ~
@13149 = ~History of Shadowdale -  Aumry Rules in Peace: 

The longest period of peaceful rule was by Lord Aumry and his wife Sylune (better known as the Witch of Shadowdale).  They ruled over the community for forty years, a period of extended peace with their neighboring dales, nations, and the elven peoples.  It was this very peace and power which made the Dale the target for attacks and sabotage by the Black Network (Zhentarim).  They sought (and still seek) to control the trade from the Moonsea to the Sword coast, and desired to make Shadowdale a vassal state of Zhentil Keep.  Lord Aumry's rule ended tragically when he was assassinated by Zhentish agents.~
@13150 = ~History of Shadowdale -  Jyordhan the False Lord: 

 Lord Aumry was assassinated by Zhentarim agents, who in turn were captured and killed by the warrior Jyordhan.  Jyordhan, with the Pendant of Ashaba in hand (the symbol of the lordship in the Dales), proceeded to present himself as the new lord, and was so acclaimed by the people.  It was unknown to the people that Jyordhan was also an agent of the Zhentarim, and that the entire proceeding had actually been a ruse. 

Jyordhan abandoned the Twisted Tower, instead establishing himself in Castle Krag east of Shadowdale.  His court was soon overrun with agents of the Black Network.  When the people eventually revolted, Zhentil Keep sent peace-keeping forces to maintain Jyordhan's rule.  Sylune, Lord Aumry's widow, now aware of the deception but a firm pacifist, did her best to keep the Dale healthy and intact during Jyordhan's evil rule. ~
@13151 = ~History of Shadowdale -  Khelben Kills Jyordhan: 

Lord Jyordhan's rule of Shadowdale ended when he encountered Khelben Arunsun, also called the Blackstaff.  The story at the time was that Jyordhan accepted an invitation from Khelben to visit Waterdeep, and there he took ill and died.  In reality, Jyordhan ambushed Khelben as the mage was leaving Shadowdale, and the Blackstaff killed him.  In either case, Khelben took hold of the Pendant of Ashaba (the symbol of the lordship in the Dales) and returned to Waterdeep with it, promising to send a suitable candidate for lordship to the Dales.  Jyordhan had ruled for five years, and without his advocacy, Castle Krag was abandoned and the Zhentil Keep troops routed.  Jyordhan's previously chosen successor was a Melvauntan named Lyran, but without the Pendant this individual was considered a pretender to the throne. ~
@13152 = ~History of Shadowdale - Lords Accepted by Acclamation: 

This acclamation of the people has formed the basis for choosing the lord of Shadowdale since the routing of the evil Lord Jyordhan by Khelben Blackstaff.  Usually a predecessor will step down as opposed to dying in office, and his chosen successor will be approved by the populace at large.  This system has had its drawbacks, as will be shown below, but in general, it has served the independent, self-willed people of the Dale very well.  They have avoided the "genetic lottery of which good bureaucracies and bad kingships are made" (a quote from the venerable Elminster).  The symbol of the lordship is the Pendant of Ashaba, a device owned by the original wizard, and used to determine the rightful lord of the Dale. ~
@13153 = ~History of Shadowdale - The Time of No Lords: 

 During the period when Khelben Blackstaff held the Pendant of Ashaba (the symbol of the lordship in the Dales), Sylune (widow of the murdered Lord Aumry) was the de facto ruler of Shadowdale, though these years were known as the Time of No Lords.  Sylune and an adventuring company known as Mane's Band were responsible for driving out the Zhentil Keep forces and keeping at bay the monsters in the area.  The Twisted Tower, the traditional seat of leadership, remained uninhabited following its abandonment by the evil Lord Jyordhan, and neither Sylune nor the companions of Mane's Band wished to assume the mantle of leader.  With time, Mane's Band passed on to other lands and adventures. ~
@13154 = ~History of Shadowdale - Doust Sulwood Becomes Lord of Shadowdale:

Three winters following his defeat of the evil Lord Jyordhan, Khelben  Blackstaff found a suitable candidate to assume leadership of the Dales, or rather a group of candidates.  They were the Knights of Myth Drannor, so named to show their interest in the elven territories and their connection with the elven peoples, and Khelben gave them the Pendant of Ashaba (the symbol of the Lordship) in return for services rendered to himself and to Shadowdale.  Their leader, the ranger Florin Falconhand, refused the honor of the lordship.  It was therefore passed to Doust Sulwood, who was made the new lord with the support of Florin and Sylune (wife of the murdered Lord Aumry), and apparently also the secret support of Khelben as well.

Doust reoccupied the Twisted Tower, driving out the last agents of the Black Network.  He also re-instituted many of Ashaba's democratic ideals, including the Lord's Court where all citizens may speak freely and air their grievances without threat of reprisal.  Doust ruled for five years and proved to be a capable ruler, beloved by the people.  The regular presence of the Knights of Myth Drannor did much to ensure the protection of the area, particularly against incursions by Lyran Nanther the Pretender.  Lyran was to have been Jyordhan's named replacement, but with the Zhentarim routed there was little validity to the claim.~
@13155 = ~History of Shadowdale - Elminster Moves to Shadowdale: 

It is of note that during the time that Doust Sulwood of the Knights of Myth Drannor assumed the role of Lord of Shadowdale, Elminster took up residence in the area.  A semi-regular visitor up to that time, he took possession of a low, abandoned tower at the foot of the Old Skull, and declared himself to be officially in retirement.  The nature of that retirement varies from active involvement in local affairs to long-term vacations on other planes.  The natives of the Dale have come to the understanding that they cannot always count on the powerful mage being in residence in times of need or danger, but when he is present in these circumstances his aid is usually given.  ~
@13156 = ~History of Shadowdale - Doust Chooses Mourngrym Amcathra to Succeed Him: 

Doust Sulwood, recommended to the position by Khelben Blackstaff, ruled Shadowdale as lord for five years.  "Seems like a millennium," he was oft known to have reported, and the tedium of court life and the lure of adventure eventually caused him to retire his position and rejoin the Knights of Myth Drannor in regular adventuring.  He handed the Pendant of Ashaba (symbol of the Lordship) on to one of the younger Knights, a Waterdhavian noble named Mourngrym Amcathra.  Mourngrym had been dispatched by Khelben from Waterdeep for other purposes, but Doust liked both the young man's straightforward honesty and his willingness to shoulder the burden of protecting the small community from myriad dangers.  Time has proven this choice a wise one.~
@13157 = ~History of Shadowdale - Shaerl and Mourngrym Meet and Marry: 

The implications of Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun "choosing" the last two lords of Shadowdale (Doust Sulwood and Mourngrym Amcathra) were not lost on the Dale's powerful neighbor to the south, Cormyr. An agent was sent northward to divine Mourngrym's true intentions and to guarantee the Dale's continued good relationship with the throne of the Purple Dragon.  The agent was a rogue named Shaerl Rowanmantle, sent by Vangerdahast (though all paperwork on this matter has been curiously incinerated in Suzail, so all is hearsay and tale).  Shaerl discovered more than she intended and fell in love with young Mourngrym.  The two married and became the lord and lady of Shadowdale.  Shaerl's loyalty is now to her husband and to the land they co-rule.  This was probably not the intention of the Cormyreans. ~
@13158 = ~History of Shadowdale -  Mourngrym's Rule:

Since being recommended to the position by outgoing Lord Doust Sulwood, Lord Mourngrym Amcathra's rule of Shadowdale has been less peaceful than he had hoped.  The First Battle of Shadowdale occurred in the Year of the Prince (1357 DR), and involved Daleland forces routing those of Lyran the Pretender.  Lyran has made repeated attempts to gain the Lordship, as was intended by the former Zhentish puppet, Lord Jyordhan.  While significant, this battle pales when compared to the larger battle fought on the same site between Bane-led Zhentil Keep forces and the Dales during the Time of Troubles (1358 DR/0 PR).  When the Battle of Shadowdale is referred to (without a number), it usually means this second battle.  In addition, Mourngrym has had to deal with a large number of skirmishes, incursions, a possible invasion from below, explosions, and other sundry disasters. 

Mourngrym and Shaerl have one child, Scotti, who is now nine winters old.  By the customs of the area, he is not considered the heir apparent, and another suitable warrior or mage may take the reins of power of the small community.  Most feel that Mourngrym will hold the Pendant until his son has reached his maturity, then abdicate in young Scotti's favor once he takes his grown name.  If this happens, it will be the first occasion of the lordship of Shadowdale passing down through a family. ~
@13159 = ~History of Tethyr:

For the past 1500 years, Tethyr has had a single, strong royal family ruling with absolute power.  When a king died or became incapacitated, his oldest son took the throne.  As the family trees of those close to power became more intertwined and complicated, there were the inevitable wars of succession and bickering over which second cousin was the "true" heir to the throne.  Civil wars were brief, however, and once the fighting was over the system returned to normal (until the next major dispute in a few hundred years or so).

The established re-occurring cycle was broken 10 years ago.  The current ruling family had been in power for over 350 years, so long that they had dropped their own family name centuries ago (no one even remembers it now) and simply called themselves Tethyr.  King Alemander IV was comfortably ruling from Castle Tethyr, and the country seemed happy enough, but there was a broad current of dissatisfaction among the people of Tethyr.  Non-humans were forbidden by law to own land, and since most rights and privileges accorded citizens were based on land ownership, they became second-class citizens as well.  Things were especially bad for elves, who were driven deep into the Forest of Tethir by royal armies.  Alemander IV took land away from rightful owners and gave it to nobles who promised larger contributions to the royal treasury.  These social and economic inequities, coupled with several harsh winters and bad harvests in a row, made the time ripe for a change.

It takes more than just a couple of lousy winters to depose a king however, it takes treachery as well.  In the case of the fall of House Tethyr it took an ambitious general and an impatient royal heir.  Prince Alemander grew tired of waiting for the robust Alemander IV to make room for him, so he struck a deal with General Nashram Sharboneth, commander of the king's largest army.  While Sharboneth marched his army toward Tethyr, bringing along a sizable group of angry peasants recruited with the promise of land reform, the would-be Alemander V downplayed alarming reports from the king's spies and advisors, silencing the most persistent permanently through murder or exile.  By the time Sharboneth's army arrived and laid siege to Castle Tethyr, it was too late for loyalists to help.

As Sharboneth launched a direct assault on the castle (using the expendable peasants as shock troops), a handful of elite soldiers let in a secret entrance by the prince would eliminate key guards and open the gates.  At the same time, the prince (one of the few people allowed to see the king directly) would murder his father.  A fire set by the elite troops would destroy evidence of treachery; the general and the prince would emerge from the conflagration and announce a new, joint government.

The plan was executed perfectly, but only up to a point.  Sharboneth double-crossed the prince; his men were much too efficient in setting the castle ablaze, and Prince Alemander (along with most of his fellow conspirators) died horribly in the fire.  At about the same time, a spy planted on the general's inner staff by the equally duplicitous Alemander murdered the general and dissolved his body with a powerful acid before anyone could come to his aid.

To make matters worse, everyone had underestimated the resentment the people felt for the royal family.  Once Castle Tethyr began to fall, there was no holding back the mob.  In one night, the proudest, strongest castle in all the country was reduced to a smoking ruin.  Everything of value - fine tapestries, plates and silverware, furniture, jewelry, weapons, clothes, armor, paintings, statues, etc.- was either stolen, burned, or just ripped apart and stomped into the dust.

As news of the fall of the royal family spread, so did the chaos.  In what is now known as the "Ten Black Days of Eleint," anyone known (or even suspected) of blood connection to the royal family was put to the sword.  This led to some darkly humorous moments, as social climbers who had bragged just a week before of being a sixth cousin twice removed of a royal aunt tried in vain to convince an angry mob that they were "only kidding."

The nobles who were the biggest supporters of the royal family also came under attack, and some baronial keeps fell.  Local leaders who had adequately distanced themselves from the Tethyr family, or were popular enough (or feared/strong enough), survived.  These surviving nobles became the initial players in the fight to decide the fate of Tethyr.

One thing was certain; any leader or type of government that too closely resembled rule under the Tethyrs would not be accepted.  "Royalist" became a dirty word in Tethyr society.  The power struggle continues to this day, and there is no sign of it ending anytime soon.~
@13160 = ~History of the Bell in the Depths:  

One of the great and mysterious sites in the Moonsea area, the Bell in the Depths, is connected with legendary Northkeep, an island kingdom that was the first great citadel of humankind in these cold lands.  Northkeep was a great and magical city, and it was under the protection of these magics that humanity first began to press back the orc hordes and take command of the sea.

The power of Northkeep made it an obvious target for orcs, giants, and other evil races.  However, these creatures were not inclined towards sea actions, and Northkeep seemed safe until the day when (according to legend) 40,000 inhuman mages, shamans, witch doctors, and priests of all foul races gathered on the northern shore of the Moonsea and began to chant, bringing the vengeance of their gods down upon the human interlopers.  The gods (at least some of them) came and destroyed their priests for disturbing them, but also sank Northkeep beneath the waves.

The upper reaches of Northkeep - its slender, now-broken spires - can be seen beneath the water by boats that sail nearby.  This is not attempted often, however, as the region is said to be haunted by the original defenders of Northkeep, seeking company in their watch over the Cold Lands.  On fog-ridden nights the bells of the tallest towers, despite being submerged, can be heard as far away as Hillsfar.  ~
@13161 = ~History of the Chosen of Mystra:  

The reason why Mystra, the Goddess of Magic, invested a portion of her divine might in mortals is not known.  One of the more popular theories, and one that is gaining more support in light of the goddess' other actions during that period,  is that Mystra foresaw the Time of Troubles (and her own passing at the hands of Helm) and chose to give some of her power to mortals in order to ensure that her successor (the female mage Midnight, as it turned out) would have a number of nearly immortal allies in the struggle against the schemes of the gods (the now dead Bane, Myrkul, and Bhaal) who precipitated the Time of Troubles by stealing the Tablets of Fate.  The theory goes on to suggest that Mystra informed Azuth at approximately the Year of the Rising Flame (0 DR), more than 1,300 years before the Time of Troubles, that some of her power must be put into the hands of mortals who would then become known as Mystra's Chosen.  This power would sleep within the bodies of those mortals, allowing Mystra to call on it only with their permission.  It would give the Chosen the innate ability to heal quickly, and would give them life spans far greater than those of ordinary mortals.  Mystra speculated that these mortals might be able to call on her power and thereby gain some special abilities, but that these powers would not rival those of a deity. (See "Powers" below.) 

The Goddess of All Magic then began to select mortals she thought to be suitable.  One of the first was the young mage Elminster, and she also singled out a promising wizard named Khelben Arunsun.  Both have proved to be worthy and capable receptacles of her power, but Mystra's other early attempts to invest her power in living humans were unsuccessful, and she came to realize that only very few mortals were of stern enough substance to contain such power within themselves without being destroyed or corrupted.  Even though some people aside from Elminster and Khelben may have possessed the requisite strength, it is possible that having lived for years prior to being visited by Mystra had set them on a path from which they were not able to deviate.  Whatever the reason, the problem needed to be solved.  To get around the difficulty, Mystra devised a plan to use herself as a vessel to breed individuals who could be nurtured and acclimated to her power from the very beginnings of their lives. 

For the father of these individuals, she picked the best example of human stock she could find: Dornal Silverhand, a nobleman and a former Harper who lived near Neverwinter.  Mystra then possessed the body of Elue Shundar, a half-elven sorceress whom Dornal was already attracted to.  Mystra revealed her presence and her plan to Elue, who happily and eagerly agreed to have the goddess share her body.  Elue had been reluctant, but under the influence of Mystra the woman became a seductress, and Dornal found his advances being suddenly returned with great fervor. 

Dornal and Mystra/Elue were wed in the Year of Drifting Stars (760 DR).  The first of seven daughters, Anastra Sylune, was born the following winter.  Sylune's six sisters emerged at one-year intervals thereafter: Endue Alustriel, Ambara Dove, Ethena Astorma (she prefers the shortened "Storm" these days), Anamanue Laeral, Alassra Shentrantra (known today as the Simbul), and Er'sseae Qilue.  These siblings have become known in Realmsian lore as the Seven Sisters. 

Dornal, who had been kept in the dark about his wife's true nature through the years (presumably because Mystra didn't want to risk losing his services), was disappointed and nearly distraught by the time his sixth child was born; he had always wanted sons as well as daughters.  More importantly, he was seeing his wife deteriorate right before his eyes. The strain of coexisting with the goddess all these years had turned Elue into a withered shell - in essence a lich, clinging to life only because Mystra's power was within her. 

When Elue was carrying the seventh child, Dornal consulted a priest who told him his wife had been possessed by an entity of great magical power.  To spare both of them any further agony, he attempted to slay his wife's physical form by severing her head from her body. 

As soon as he had done this, Mystra was forced to reveal herself to him, and she went on to explain her scheme.  Just as she had worried would happen, Dornal was aghast at how he and his wife had been used by the goddess.  He turned his back on the corpse of his wife, abandoned his lands and his children, and vanished into the North.  Mystra bore him no ill will, and in fact protected him for the final 30 years of his life.  When Dornal finally did meet his end he called out to Mystra, and the goddess granted him continued existence as her servant.  Now known as the Watcher, Dornal Silverhand travels the world unseen by mortals on a continuing mission to locate candidates to swell the ranks of the Chosen and to identify possible threats to Mystra and her minions.

@13162 = ~History of the Dales and the Elven Court:

The founding of the Dalelands long preceded the creation of any of the existing Dales by hundreds of years, and the year numbering system known as Dalereckoning is actually a commemoration of humankind being given permission to settle in the lands north and west of the Inner Sea.  Most of the current Dales are relative newcomers, the older having been abandoned, destroyed, or overrun long ago.  In those ancient days, when Suzail and Chondathan (now called Saerloon) were mere coastal trading posts, the elves who ruled this forest entertained a request from settlers from the East; refugees and farmers from far-off Impiltur and Damara.  This request was to farm and settle the borders of the great forest Cormanthor, in particular the rich delves and dales along the rivers Arkhen and Ashaba.  These newcomers did not wish to lumber or clear the inhabited forest, but only to settle on the rich territories on its edges, and unlike some other settlers (early Sembia comes to mind) were willing to ask permission.

The lords of the Elven Court granted that request in return for aid from these new Dalelanders against outside aggression, both monstrous (orcs and goblins from the lands of Thar) and human (the rising powers in Cormyr and Sembia).  In commemoration of this pact, humans and elves raised the Standing Stone that is now seen where the Moonsea Ride reaches Rauthauvyr's Road, the road from Essembra to Hillsfar.  It is from the date of the raising of this stone that Dalereckoning is counted.  According to the pact made, the Dalesmen would only settle those regions that were unforested or unclaimed by the elves.  As the elven woods receded under the axes of further invaders and settlers, old Dales perished and new ones came into being along the borders of the woods.  People, both good and bad, have raised petty nations in the Dalelands since, though any one Dale that turned against the pact would have to deal with the others.  Each of the Dales is a large swath of farms and fields, with a few scattered settlements and usually one central marketplace, capital, or Dale center.  These centers are often, but not always, named after the Dales they are in, adding to the confusion as to what is a Daleland's territory.

The Dales are not city-states, for their largest groupings of population rate as towns at best, and they lack the defensive walls common throughout the Heartlands.  They are neither true nations in the fashion of Cormyr or Sembia, and occupy a gray middle ground wherein they are nothing more, or less, than Dales.

Each Dale has slightly different laws, customs, and military organizations.  Many rely on the work of charismatic heroes and adventuring companies for aid in times of trouble, and a large number of these individuals use the region as a base.  This attraction for adventurers is further increased by the large number of elven and pre-elven ruins in the area and the departure of the Elven Court for Evermeet, leaving the woods open for exploration and exploitation.

The history of the Dales is filled with battles and attacks on its various members.  In the Year of the Worm (1356 DR), Scardale, under the command of Lashan Aumersair, launched a number of swift attacks, conquering a number of the surrounding Dales.  A coalition of forces from the others, as well as Sembia, Cormyr, and Zhentil Keep crushed the invaders and occupied Scardale.  During the Time of Troubles (1358 DR/0 PR), Shadowdale was attacked by Zhentil Keep.  More recently, the Dalelands have committed forces to a unified army under King Azoun IV of Cormyr to turn back the Tuigan Invasion (1360 DR).~
@13163 = ~History of the Dead Three:  'KNUCKLEBONES, SKULL BOWLING, AND THE EMPTY THRONE' 

 In ages past there was but one god of strife, death, and the dead, and he was known as Jergal, Lord of the End of Everything.  Jergal fomented and fed on the discord among mortals and powers alike.  When beings slew each other in their quest for power or in their hatred, he welcomed them into his shadowy kingdom of eternal gloom.  As all things died, everything came to him eventually, and over time he built his power into a kingdom unchallenged by any other god.  Eventually, however, he grew tired of his duties for he knew them too well.  Without challenge there is nothing, and in nothingness there is only gloom.  In such a state, the difference between absolute power and absolute powerlessness is undetectable.  

During this dark era, there arose three powerful mortals - Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul - who lusted after the power Jergal wielded.  The trio forged an unholy pact, agreeing that they would dare to seek such ultimate power or die in the attempt.  Over the length and breadth of the Realms they strode, seeking powerful magic and spells and defying death at every turn.  No matter what monster they confronted or what spells they braved, the three mortals emerged unscathed at every turn.  Eventually the trio destroyed  one of the Seven Lost Gods, and they each seized a portion of his divine essence for themselves.  

The trio then journeyed into the Gray Waste and sought out the Castle of Bone.  Through armies of skeletons, legions of zombies, hordes of noncorporeal undead, and a gauntlet of liches they battled.  Eventually they reached the object of their lifelong quest - the Bone Throne.  

"I claim this throne of evil," shouted Bane the tyrant.   "I'll destroy you before you can raise a finger," threatened Bhaal the assassin. '''"And I shall imprison your essence for eternity," promised Myrkul the necromancer. 

Jergal arose from his throne with a weary expression and said, " The Throne is yours.  I have grown weary of this empty power.  Take it if you wish - I promise to serve and guide you as your seneschal until you grow comfortable with the position."  Before the stunned trio could react, the Lord of the Dead continued: "Who among you shall rule?"

The trio immediately fell to fighting amongst themselves while Jergal looked on with indifference.  When eventually it appeared that either they would all die of exhaustion or battle on for an eternity, the Lord of the End of Everything intervened.  "After all you have sacrificed, would you come away with nothing?  Why don't you divide the portfolios of the office and engage in a game of skill for them?" asked Jergal.  

Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul considered the god's offer and agreed.  Jergal took the heads of his three most powerful liches and gave them to the trio that they would compete by bowling the skulls.  Each mortal rolled a skull across the Gray Waste, having agreed that the winner would be he who bowled the farthest.  

Malar the Beastlord arrived to visit Jergal at this moment.  After quickly ascertaining that the winner of the contest would get all of Jergal's power, he chased off after the three skulls to make sure that the contest would be halted until he had a chance to participate for part of the prize.  Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul again fell to fighting as it was obvious their sport was ruined, and again Jergal intervened.  "Why don't you allow Lady Luck to decide so you don't have to share with the Beast?"

The trio agreed, and Jergal broke off his skeletal finger bones and gave them to the players.  When Malar returned from chasing the skulls, he found that the trio had just finished a game of knucklebones.

Bane cried out triumphantly, "As winner, I choose to rule for all eternity as the ultimate tyrant.  I can induce hatred and strife at my whim, and all will bow down before me while in my kingdom."

Myrkul, who had won second place, declared, "But I choose the dead, and by doing so I truly win, because all you are lord over, Bane, will eventually be mine.  All things must die - even gods."

Bhaal, who finished third, demurred, "I choose death, and it is by my hand that all that you rule Lord Bane will eventually pass to Lord Myrkul.  Both of you must pay honor to me and obey my wishes, since I can destroy your kingdom, Bane, by murdering your subjects, and I can starve your kingdom, Myrkul, by staying my hand."

Malar growled in frustration, but could do nothing, and yet again only the beasts were left for him.  

And Jergal merely smiled, for he had been delivered.

@13164 = ~History of the Dragon Coast:  

The history of the Dragon Coast is the history of money, particularly the darker side of the coin.  Situated on the main trade routes between the Inner Sea and the Sword Coast, these lands never coalesced into a solid, coherent nation, like Cormyr or Sembia. Instead small petty city-states have risen and fallen, powered by greed and the most powerful merchant or pirate faction of the day. 

As a result, the Dragon Coast has always been the home of the smuggler, the pirate, the rogue, and the hired killer. It has been the place where those seeking to skirt the laws of more civilized nations to the north make landfall.  It is here that the Red Wizards gain their access to the Western Heartlands, and where the Cult of the Dragon launches its plots to the south.  And it is here that independent secret societies and assassin guilds have their greatest power. 

The last semblance of organized resistance to this trend was the reign of Verovan, last of the kings of Westgate.  The monarchy of Westgate had long worked closely with the various mercantile and pirate factions, but Verovan attempted to stem the growing power of the merchant houses and petty lords.  His sudden and mysterious death without acceptable heirs in 1248 DR opened the door for much of what now is commonplace in the Dragon Coast - corruption and treachery. 

It should be noted that while Verovan's name is still venerated in these lands, better known is Immurk, the greatest of the Inner Sea Pirates, a brash and flamboyant rogue who united a pirate fleet beneath him and ruled from 1164 DR to his death in 1201 DR.  Such it is in the Dragon Coast, that good people are venerated, but the power of darker rogues is imitated. ~
@13165 = ~History of the Drow, The Descent:  

We know very little of the Ilythiiri, or "Elves of the South," before this crucial event.  Even then they were known as "Dark Elves," for the hue of their skins.  They dwelt in the jungles and hot forests of the South.  A proud, warlike, culturally advanced (some sages of other elven peoples say "decadent") folk, the Ilythiiri attacked all neighbors, including other elven tribes.  Their cruel raids and depredations, ordered by warlike nobility and the clergy of their two cruel deities, Ghaunadaur and Lolth, forced elves, humans, dwarves, and others to ally against them. 

Defeated in a series of titanic magical battles, the dark elves fled into underground warrens they had earlier discovered.  This event, known as "the Descent," marked the end of the drow as a surface-dwelling race. ~
@13166 = ~History of the Drow, The Dark Wars:   

The warlike drow nature did not change when they escaped their surface foes during The Descent.  In fact, they immediately launched a series of wars to establish territories in the Underdark.  They began by stealing and seizing dwarven magical items, and using them against the dwarves - establishing an enmity that is still strong today. 

The drow then fought among themselves, noble against noble, priest against priestess, for rule of their new realm.  This all-out war ended amid great magical explosions that brought down the roof of the largest dwarven cavern they had seized, great Bhaerynden.  The ceiling collapsed entirely, burying many drow and the shattered dwarven cities.  The cavern, now open to the sky, became known as The Great Rift.  The surviving drow nobles gathered what people, slaves, and equipment they could seize, and fled into the Underdark in search of places to dwell.  "The Scattering" brought about the many rival, self-interested cities where most drow live today.

@13167 = ~History of the Fateful Coin:  

Old tales tell that luck plays a crucial role in each person's life.  When each new-born baby enters into the Realms, Tymora flips a coin formed from the remnants of the original goddess of luck, Tyche.   Beshaba calls it in the air - the moon (heads) or the cloak (tails).  If Beshaba is right, that person is cursed with misfortune for the rest of his or her days.  If she's wrong, Lady Luck smiles on that child for the rest of his or her life.  For some rare beings, the coin lands edge on - and these luckless few can forge their own fates, for they have more freedom over their destinies than the powers themselves.

@13168 = ~History of the Last March of the Giants:

East of the Great Rift in the Eastern Shaar once stood a land of the titans.  This empire rose at the dawn of time in Faerun, and its lords thought to challenge the gods in their arrogance.  In punishment, the powers cursed the reigning monarch of the land with fascination and his brethren with devotion.  The powers then dropped a star onto the land.  The impact of the fallen star created a huge valley later known as the Sea of Fallen Stars.  Slowly picking up speed, the ball rolled through the titan nation and onward to the south.

Unable to contain his curiosity, the titan king ran off after the bouncing sphere and his devoted followers dutifully followed his tracks.  The meteorite rolled on and on until it reached the Great Sea and vanished into the depths.  The monarch dove into the sea, and, lemming-like, the entire titan race dove in after him, never to be seen again.

Ashamed at the destruction they had wrought, the powers vowed to keep both curiosity and loyalty firmly in check to avoid such disasters in the future.  They have done so to this day, preventing both new ideas from being pursued with any speed and the intelligent races of Toril from ever fully cooperating.  ~
@13169 = ~History of the Moonsea:  

The Moonsea has a long history as the border between the elven lands to the south and the darker, more sinister lands of the Ride and Thar, home of dragons and giant and ogre tribes in great multitudes.  The deep sea was an excellent barrier to the raiders, as those tribes who sought invasion had to detour around and through the lands that would eventually hold Yulash, Zhentil Keep, and Hillsfar. 

The first true settlement in Moonsea was Northkeep, a shining citadel established as a beacon of civilization and a jumping-off point for merchants seeking trade with the dwarves of the North - including not only Tethyamar, but the clans of the Cold Lands - who traded their metalwork and craft for much-needed magic.  In the end, Northkeep was sunk beneath the icy waters of the Moonsea by the inhuman forces, and humankind suffered one of many setbacks in the region. 

So has been the nature of human habitation of this region since the beginning.  Human settlements thrive for a few years, usually through sheer willpower and on the strength of a sharp sword, and then are overrun by goblins, orcs, dragons, beholders, or giants.  Phlan has fallen and risen again.  Yulash is a ruin where a decade ago there was a thriving town.  Hulburg and Sulasspryn are empty hulks.  Each of the cities of the Moonsea seems threatened with extinction in its turn, then is rebuilt. 

This cycle may be the reason that only the strongest and the most savage survive, even prosper, in the lands of the Moonsea.  The greatest cities - Hillsfar, Mulmaster, and the impenetrable Zhentil Keep - are all ruled by evil people who control their lands with iron grips.  The lesser cities, Elventree, Phlan, and Thentia, may be less evil, but have a strong, independent, almost chaotic nature.  In many ways the Moonsea is a frontier, with a frontier mentality.

@13170 = ~History of the North - The First Flowering:  

For millennia, gold elves dwelt in Illefarn (where Waterdeep now stands) and Eaerlann (along the River Shining).  From their ornate forest cities they traded with emerging human nations like Netheril and Illusk and repulsed the attacks of the goblin races.  Meanwhile, dwarven clans united as the nation of Delzoun, named for the dwarf who forged the union.  The nation, existing primarily underground, extended from the Ice Mountains to the Nether Mountains.  Silver Moon Pass was its western border and the Narrow Sea its eastern shore.  Orcs came from north of the Spine of the World but were turned back in great slaughter by the elves.  To this day, this is the homeland and stronghold for orcs and similar races. 
~
@13171 = ~History of the North - The Crown Wars:  

Humans immigrated in bands from the Shining Sea and up to the Sword Coast.  They became seafarers, striking out across the waves to the Moonshaes, Mintarn, Ruathym, and the northern islands.  Elves engaged in an unceasing war against each other with the humans and orcs taking over the resulting ruins.  Perhaps the greatest calamity to befall the Fair Folk was the Dark Disaster, a killing magic that took the form of a dark, burning cloud.  It enshrouded the kingdom of Mieyritar, and when it faded away some months later, not an elf lived - nor were trees left; only an open, blasted moor: the High Moor. 

All was not dark for the elves. Although in retreat, as barbarian humans and orc hordes grew in strength, their power rose in the Elven Court and Evereska (remaining a stronghold to this day).  They conceived of cooperation between dwarves, kindly humans, and other elves for mutual survival against orcs, marauding humans, and the tide of beasts (ogres, bugbears, trolls, goblins, gnolls, and other nonhuman creatures) led by the rising power of giants.  Astonishingly, in at least three places - the Fallen Kingdoms and the cities of Silverymoon and Myth Drannor - they succeeded with shining grace. 

To the east, on the sandy shores of the calm and shining Narrow Sea, human fishing villages grew into small towns and then joined together as the nation of Netheril.  Sages believe the fishing towns were unified by a powerful human wizard who had discovered a book of great magic power that had survived from the Days of Thunder - a book that legend calls the Nether Scrolls.  Under this nameless wizard and those who followed, Netheril rose in power and glory, becoming both the first human land in the North and the most powerful.  Some say this discovery marked the birth of human wizardry, since before then, mankind had only shamans and witch doctors.  For over 3,000 years Netheril dominated the North, but even its legendary wizards were unable to stop their final doom.

@13172 = ~History of the North - Recent History of the North:  

In the waning summer months of 1367, an immense orc horde descended from the Spine of the World, intent on winding its way south into the trade lands of the North. This force of orcs, led by King Greneire, surged its way south between the Moonwood and the Cold Wood, stopping just outside the Citadel of Many Arrows. 

King Obould, orc ruler of the Citadel of Many Arrows, was terrified at the prospect of another orc horde, despite the fact that he knew they should be working together against the humans of the North and the spawn of Hellgate Keep. His tribal shamans, however, had been predicting a treacherous fall of the citadel - and they'd told the king that he'd be deposed by other orcs. 

Thus, it was a dark day when King Greneire and his horde of 150,000 orcs appeared on the plains outside the Citadel of Many Arrows. King Obould announced to his followers that this horde had been sent to dislodge them from their home and send them out to be scavengers among the plains. He vowed that, with Gruumsh as his witness, the Citadel of Many Arrows would slaughter these treacherous orcs "like elves during a festival." 

For four months, the 40,000 orcs within the citadel held their ground. Assault after assault was mounted against the high walls of the garrison, but the attacking orcs were losing far more than the defenders. Still, the living conditions within the walls - never too good to begin with - created losses of their own. 

The battle for the Citadel of Many Arrows culminated during the first week of Uktar. As another light blanket of snow sought to bury the gathered orcs, King Greneire threw his entire remaining army at the citadel, bursting its gates and pitting orc against orc in a flurry of swords. As the two orc kings sought one another out along the ramparts, the citadel began to burn. 

The orcs that survive the battle still speak of the superhuman prowess of the two kings as they battled one another before their troops. Finally, however, King Obould ran Greneire through with his long sword, but Obould was severely wounded by the time Greneire had breathed his last breath. The orcs erupted into battle once again, and no one is quite certain what became of King Obould. 

It was through the smoke and snow that the victors of the conflict emerged: the dwarves of Clan Warcrown along with a contingent of troops from Silverymoon. Charging in through the shattered gates, these new attackers quickly routed the exhausted orcs of the citadel, sending them scurrying off into the wilderness. 

King Emerus Warcrown now rules the Citadel of Many Arrows, though the dwarves now call the city by its old name of Felbarr. Most in the North still tend to refer to the city as the Citadel, however, waiting to see if it can withstand the next orc horde. King Warcrown has put out a call for all dwarves to help defend the citadel, and news of a new vein of gold and silver is spreading rapidly through dwarven communities.

@13173 = ~History of the North -  The Elven Exodus:  

This era left behind elven strongholds ripe for pillaging by humans and orcs. When elves chose to leave the North and travel to Evermeet, their works quickly disappeared, leaving only places like the Old Road and a ruined port in the High Forest to mark Eaerlann's passing. And yet it was not only the elves who would disappear from their long-held homes; the human nation of Netheril also stood on the brink of history. 

Doom for Netheril came in the form of a desert, devouring the Narrow Sea and spreading to fill its banks with dry dust and blowing sand. Legend states when the great wizards of Netheril realized their land was lost, they abandoned it and their countrymen, fleeing to all corners of the world and taking the secrets of wizardry with them. More likely, this was a slow migration that began 3,000 years ago and reached its conclusion 1,500 years later. 

Whatever the truth, wizards no longer dwelled in Netheril. To the north, the once-majestic dwarven stronghold of Delzoun fell upon hard days. Then the orcs struck. Orcs have always been foes in the North, surging out of their holes every few tens of generations when their normal haunts can no longer support their burgeoning numbers. This time they charged out of their caverns in the Spine of the World, poured out of abandoned mines in the Graypeaks, screamed out of lost dwarfholds in the Ice Mountains, raged forth from crypt complexes in the Nether Mountains, and stormed upward from the bowels of the High Moon Mountains. Never before or since has there been such an outpouring of orcs. Delzoun crumbled before this onslaught and was driven in on itself. Netheril, without its wizards, was wiped from the face of history. The Eaerlann elves alone withstood the onslaught, and with the aid of the treants of Turlang and other unnamed allies, were able to stave off the final days of their land for yet a few centuries more. 

In the east, Eaerlann built the fortress of Ascalhorn and turned it over to refugees from Netheril as Netherese followers built the town of Karse in the High Forest. The fleeing Netherese founded Llorkh and Loudwater. Others wandered the mountains, hills, and moors north and west of the High Forest, becoming ancestors of the Uthgardt and founders of Silverymoon, Everlund, and Sundabar.

@13174 = ~History of the North - The Spread of Humankind:

The adaptable humans made use of magic they could seize or learn from the Proud Peoples to defeat all enemies, breaking (for a time) the power of giants and orcs. Waterdeep was founded. The last of the pure blood elves died out, a result of continued marriages with humans.

In the far west, men also dwelled - wise, clever primitives called the Ice Hunters. They lived simple lives on the coast since time beyond reckoning, countless generations before Netheril's first founders set foot on the Narrow Sea's western shore. Yet this peaceful folk fell prey to another invasion from the south: crude longships that carried a tall, fair-haired, warlike race who displaced the Ice Hunters from their ancestral lands.

This race, known as the Northmen, spread farms and villages along the coast from the banks of the Winding Water to the gorges of the Mirar. Northmen warriors drove the simple Ice Hunters farther and farther north, forced the goblinoids back into their mountain haunts, and instigated the last Council of Illefarn. Within 500 years of the Northmen's arrival, Illefarn was no more - its residents had migrated to Evermeet.

From the Coast, Northmen sailed westward, claiming and establishing colonies on the major western islands of Ruathym and Gundarlun, eventually spreading to all the islands in the northern sea. Others migrated northward, past the Spine of the World, and became the truly savage barbarians of Icewind Dale.

In the centuries that followed, Ascalhom became Hellgate Keep when it fell into the hands of fiends, and Eaerlann collapsed under the attack of a new orc horde. The elves fled southeast, joining with Northmen, Netherese descendants, and dwarves to form what would later be known as the Fallen Kingdom. This realm was short-lived and collapsed under the next orcish invasion - though in dying, it dealt the goblin races a blow from which they have yet to recover.~
@13175 = ~History of the North - The Might of Men:

Along the coast, in what was once the elven community of Illefarn, humanity was once again rising in power. Merchants from the south, tribesmen from the North, and seafarers from western islands had created a village around a trading post on a deep-water harbor, first known as Nimoar's Hold after the Uthgardt chieftain whose tribe seized and fortified the ramshackle village. Nimoar and his successors, known as War Lords, led the men of Waterdeep (as it had become known to ship captains) in a slowly losing battle against the trolls. In a final, climactic battle, the trolls breached the aging palisade and all seemed lost - until the magic of Ahghairon of Silverymoon turned luck against the trolls, destroying and scattering them.

Ahghairon, heir to the heritage and learning of Netheril, stayed in Waterdeep, and in his 112th year he again saved the city - this time from itself. In so doing, he created the Lords of Waterdeep. The city grew into the greatest in the North, possibly in all Faerun.  With Waterdeep as a firm anchor, civilization forged cautiously into the wilderness. Illuskan (now Luskan) was taken from the orcs. Loudwater, Llorkh, Triboar, Longsaddle, Secomber, and other towns were settled by pioneers from Waterdeep, sponsored by Waterdhavian merchant families.

Though it's been centuries since the last orc invasion, there's still constant strife. Barbarians harass merchants, travelers, and towns, the seas swim with Northmen pirates, and wars have marred the land in recent years. Luskan, now a fierce merchant city known to harbor - and support - pirates, waged a war with the island realm of Ruathym over an act of piracy against one of the few legitimate Luskan merchant ships. The war raged for nearly a year, with Ruathym slowly losing ground. When it appeared Luskan would finally win the naval war and land on the island itself, the Lords' Alliance entered the fray. They threatened war against Luskan if the skirmishes didn't stop immediately. Unable to fight a two-front war efficiently, Luskan canceled its invasion plans.

Tensions between Luskan and Ruathym are still high, and their ships are often seen taking potshots at each other as they pass, often just a wave or two away from each other. The government of Ruathym has recently been sending adventurers into the hills of its island realm, looking for mercenaries who are killing merchants, farmers, and woodsmen. Ruathym believes Luskan still has a presence on the island, trying to win through subversion and terrorism what it could not accomplish through war.

To the far north, the Ten-Towns have finished rebuilding after being nearly destroyed by the monstrous forces of Akar Kessel. With help from the tundra barbarians living nearby, they've built and repaired their cities, replanted the sparse foliage, and - most importantly - replenished the morale of their citizens. A recent trader who passed through the area carrying 17 wagons of rare oak lumber said that it was nearly impossible to determine who's a barbarian and who isn't. "They're living together!" he reported in amazement.~
@13176 = ~History of the North - 1368, Year of the Banner:  

 As the dwarves settled in for the winter in their reclaimed city of Felbarr, a group of Zhentarim-sponsored adventurers broke into Great Worm Cavern, slaying Elrem the Wise, shaman leader of the Great Worm tribe.  As the tribe's warriors descended into the ranks of the evil adventurers, teleportation magic spirited at least three of those responsible - as well as a vast amount of treasure stolen from Elrem - to safety. 

According to Themrin, the tribe's present shaman, Elrem promised to "watch over the tribe in spirit now that my mortal form is destroyed." Despite the reassuring words of Elrem, the tribe suffered through an oppressive winter that included both heavy snow, scarce game, and low morale. 

Trusted visitors to the barbarian encampment report that Themrin and Gweshen "Ironhand" Talistars are wearing some form of armor made from the scales of Elrem. This use of their former shaman's body as "protection" was supposedly ordained through a dream vision. The armor appears as little more than a supple leather armor, but seems to deflect blows and protect as well as full plate mail. 

Nesme reported a drastic rise in the number of troll attacks in the Evermoors, and various sources confirm that something is driving the trolls out of the moors. Whatever is behind the trolls' exodus is destined to remain a mystery for the remainder of the year, as adventuring parties expend themselves against the never-ending supply of trolls that are fleeing the bog. 

In the most surprising move of the year, the Blue Bear Tribe, led by the shaman/chieftain Tanta Hagara, marched on the fiend-ridden fortress of Hellgate Keep. While a brief struggle for political control of the city was reported by various sources, Tanta Hagara emerged as the new ruler of the city. 
~
@13177 = ~History of the North - 1369, Year of the Gauntlet:

The tumultuous climate of Hellgate Keep continued to provide adventuring activity. A group of Harpers infiltrated the city using cloaking magic and revealed that Tanta Hagara was actually an annis. This revelation did nothing to hamper the Blue Bear's respect for their powerful chieftain however, and the city responded to the unmasking by attacking caravans en route to Sundabar. In addition, a few expeditionary forces of tanar'ri were sent to harass the Citadel of the Mists, Sundabar, and Silverymoon. Tanta Hagara informed her "loyal troops" that gates existed in these cities that could allow other tanar'ri to "join us in the glorious battles to come as we take control of all of the North!"

Alustriel cast powerful magical spells in the defense of Silverymoon against the raiding tanar'ri, and the city itself suffered no damage from their attack. The Mistmaster of the Citadel of the Mists likewise aided in the defense of his citadel, though reports still rage about the assistance of the treants of the High Forest.

Sundabar suffered from Hellgate Keep's attack, as the fiends broke through the walls and raised havoc along the city streets. While adventurers battled the fiends, Helm Dwarffriend led a large contingent of the city guard to drive the remainder from Sundabar. Still, the fiends from Hellgate Keep left the city with the satisfaction of knowing that it was burning in their wake. Within two days, however, the fires were extinguished, and Sundabar has since rebuilt from the attack.

By mid Eleasias, rumors that Turlang, the powerful treant who resides in the northern High Forest, was actively defending the woodlands near the Citadel of the Mists reached the ears of Tanta Hagara, the hag-ruler of Hellgate Keep. News that Turlang was aiding the Mistmaster did not escape her notice, and the belief that the Citadel of the Mists was holding an extra-planar artifact only added to the hag's interest.

Tanta assembled a large force consisting of more than 100 tanar'ri and other fiends as well as 500 members of the Blue Bear tribe to raze the Citadel of the Mists. But as the evil forces marched their way into the High Forest, the Mistmaster put his own plan into motion. Two Harper agents, a bard named Cryshana Fireglen and a priest of Mystra known as Spellviper, infiltrated Hellgate Keep disguised as members of the Blue Bear tribe. Each carried with them part of an extra-planar artifact called the Gatekeeper's Crystal.

The Gatekeeper's Crystal is an artifact shaped like a three-pointed star that is made of onyx and an unknown metal that entwines itself through the gem. Each point of the star is a separate piece that can be combined together to create the artifact or separated to form three powerful magical items. While the crystal can be used in different manners, it was primarily created to bring down wards, including mythals and other powerful protections. According to legend, it was created by a powerful lich who used it to render clerics powerless, stripping them of their ability to turn undead and nullifying necromantic magic within a 50-mile radius.

The Mistmaster had a different use for the Gatekeeper's Crystal, but he needed volunteers to aid him in placing two shards of the crystal at precise locations within the warded city of Hellgate Keep. In particular, he needed two people who would be willing to trade their lives to exterminate the fiends of Hellgate Keep forever. Spellviper and Cryshana agreed to the suicide mission.  Holding the pieces of the crystal, the two Harpers waited for the Mistmaster to activate the magic with his third piece, initiating the magic that would tear Hellgate Keep asunder. When a blazing beam of purple energy illuminated the skies over the keep, no one within the fiend's stronghold had time to wonder what was happening.

The power of the Gatekeeper's Crystal forced the wards to cascade upon the city, causing an implosion that shook the ground for more than 100 miles. As quickly as the wards surrounding Hellgate Keep collapsed, the crystal released the magical energy in an explosion that leveled every building in the city, leaving nothing but fist-sized chunks of rocks where Hellgate Keep once stood. Not a living creature stirred in the remains; all was silent and lifeless.

The force of tanar'ri from Hellgate Keep was unsure what had happened but had felt the tremor when the Gatekeeper's Crystal had been activated. They were fighting for their own lives, however, as the treants, korred, centaurs, satyrs, dryads, and other creatures of the High Forest - including defenders of the Citadel of the Mists - battered them into the moist earth. One of the North's most notable rulers fell in the battle, however, but he took at least six tanar'ri with him to his grave. Faurael Blackhammer, the lord protector of Triboar, fell alongside his troops near the conclusion of the conflict.

Within weeks after the final battle with Hellgate Keep, treants blocked passage farther north at the joining of the Heart-blood and Delimbiyr rivers. While the treants care little for hunters and adventurers passing through the area, all caravans seeking passage north to Sundabar have been repulsed - and this is not a matter that the treants wish to negotiate.

In another mishap blamed on Turlang, Tumstone Pass was blocked by a tremendous avalanche. This final calamity sealed the Upvale from any major force of men. Travel into the area formerly occupied by Hellgate Keep is now limited to adventurers and other brave travelers.

The Mistmaster has been questioned repeatedly by some of the most powerful wizards in the Realms, including Elminster of Shadowdale and Khelben Arunsun, about the current location of the Gatekeeper's Crystal. Most sources claim that the pieces of the crystal have been scattered amongst the planes again, but no one is certain.

Near Nesme, the source of the trolls' exodus is revealed. Fog and cloud giants have taken up residence in the moor, driving the trolls from the giants' new "homeland."  While it's unknown how many giants have taken up residence in the High Moor, estimates range up to several hundred. A thick mist continually hangs in the air of the Evermoors now, even more persistent and thick than the mist before the giants' arrival. Many believe that these new mists are the work of the cloud giants, but none can be certain.

Alustriel of Silverymoon sent a detachment of guards to investigate the eastern borders of the moor, and the guards returned with news that a gathering of around 20 fog giants who were "of good nature and quite friendly" had taken up residence in a formerly troll-infested area.

Guards from neighboring Nesme were not so fortunate, however, running into a clan of violent, boulder-hurling fog and cloud giants who nearly decimated their unit. In addition, a group of adventurers crawled into Nesme with terrible burns, reporting that they had run into a black dragon at a fog giant encampment. Overall, it appears that both good and evil giants now call the moor their home.~
@13178 = ~History of the North - Return of the Beast (1367 - ?):  

Sages, philosophers, historians, and priests alike feel an ill-boding in the chill air. They predict a slow change over the next decade, but within the lifetime of men born on the first day of this age. They believe that the beasts that once ruled the land plan to return to claim what's rightfully theirs, imprisoning and enslaving the crowns. Where elves once reigned, men now rule, but their hold - as true for all civilizations before - is tenuous at best. 
~
@13179 = ~History of the North - 137O, Year of the Tankard:  

Even before spring has graced the Savage North, reports of treants massing in the High Forest have reached all of the northern cities. It seems that all of the creatures of the forest have mobilized to restore the High Forest after the fall of Hellgate Keep. Something must still reside below the ruins of Hellgate Keep, however, for the Company of the Jaded Heart never emerged from the depths below the city. The treants have since blocked entrance into the ruins, sealing whatever evil still lurks within far below the sight of man. 

But there is other activity in the North as well. Luskan still flirts with war, tempting neighboring cities and yet staying just below the wrath of Waterdeep. The barbarians still brew in the north, quick to take offense at innocent incursions into their sacred holdings. Rumors of Zhentarim agents scouring the Fallen Lands for powerful magic from long-lost Netheril continue to circulate. And adventurers still abound in the Savage Frontier.

@13180 = ~History of the Red Ravens:  

One of the few long-standing mercenary companies that operate in Cormyr, the Red Ravens have a strength on paper of 110 swords, but can easily triple that number with new hires if they get a sufficiently large contract.  They have been kept on retainer by the government of Cormyr with the stated purpose of cleaning out the Stonelands to the north.  They have been moderately successful in this goal, but the Stonelands are still far from being a safe territory.  

The Red Ravens are commanded by Rayanna the Rose, a veteran of the Horde crusade.  They are noted for their honesty and trustworthiness, as they do not wish to jeopardize their royal charter.  Most of their troops are armed with studded leather and carry long swords.  They charge 200 gold pieces per week for the services of their 110-being unit.  Their symbol is a red raven amulet.   
~
@13181 = ~History of the Sisters of Light and Darkness:

This was the birth of the world and the heavens.  After Lord Ao created Realmspace, there was a period of timeless nothingness, a misty realm of shadows before light and dark were separate entities.  Within this dim chaos stalked 13 lords of shadow, the Shadevari - whether they came form elsewhere or are children of the shadow itself, none can say.

Eventually this primordial essence coalesced into twin beautiful goddesses who were yin and yang to each other; they were so close they thought of themselves as one being.  The Two-Faced Goddess created the heavenly bodies of the crystal sphere and together infused them with life to form the Earthmother, Chauntea.  (Although Chauntea has since contracted her essence to encompass only Abeir-Toril, in the beginning she embodied all matter in Realmspace.)  This new universe was lit by the face of the silver-haired goddess, who called herself Selune, and darkened by the welcoming tresses of the raven-haired goddess, Shar, but no heat or fire existed within it.

Chauntea begged for warmth so that she could nurture life and living creatures upon the planets that were her body and limbs, and the two sisters-Who-Were-One become divided, as for the first time they were of two minds.  Silvery Selune contested with her dark sister over whether or not to bring further life to the worlds.  During this great conflagration, the gods of war, disease, murder, and death, among others, were created from residues of the deific battle.  At one point during the battle, Selune seized the advantage and reached across time and space to a land of eternal fire.  Fighting the pain of the blaze, which burned her sorely, she broke off a fragment of that ever-living flame and ignited one of the heavenly bodies so that it burned in the sky and warmed Chauntea.

Incensed, Shar redoubled her attack on her injured twin and began to snuff out all light and heat throughout the crystal sphere.  Again Selune gave of herself and tore the divine essence of magic from her body, flinging it desperately at her sister in defense of life in the sphere.  This essence entered Shar, ripped an equal portion of energy from her, and reformed behind her as the goddess of magic, known now as Mystra, but then as Mystryl.  Though Mystryl was composed of both light and dark magic, she favored her first mother Selune initially, allowing the silver goddess to win an uneasy truce with her more powerful, dark twin.  Consumed by bitterness at her defeat, Shar vowed eternal revenge.

The twin goddesses contested for eons as life struggled into existence on Toril and the other planets under Chauntea's watchful gaze.  Shar remained powerful, but bitterly alone, while Selune waxed and waned in power, often drawing strength from her allied Daughters and sons and like-minded immigrant deities.  Over time, Shar grew strong again, aided by the shadevari who preferred night to blinding light and who stalked the Realms seeking to meld light and dark into shadowy chaos once again.  Shar's plot to reform the world after her own desires was undone when Azuth, the High One, formerly the greatest of all mortal spellcasters and now consort to Mystra (incarnate successor to Mystryl), found a way to imprison the shadevari in a pocket-sized crystal sphere located beyond the edges of the world by creating the illusion of a realm of shadows.  The Lords of Shadow were drawn to investigate, and before they discovered the trick, Azuth imprisoned the shadevari with the Shadowstar, a key of shadows forged by Gond.  The High Lord then hurled the key into the endless reaches of the cosmos allowing life to flourish on in Chauntea's loving hands.~
@13182 = ~History of the Unicorn Run:  

Bards and sages pass down the tale that the headwaters of the Unicorn Run are, in truth, the Font of Life, and a cradle of fecundity.  Each natural race is said to have emerged from the womb of Chauntea onto Toril at the river's source, and then traveled down the Unicorn Run to the outside world.  Some say that a daughter of Chauntea resides at the river's source to usher the newborns into the world, while others claim that Shialla midwifes the process.

Regardless of the truth, the elves, korreds, and halflings all agree that the Unicorn Run is sacred to life and a site of incredible purity.  As a result, all three races have strong taboos about extended trips up the run, for if the river is ever fouled, then no new races will ever be born on Toril again.

@13183 = ~History of the Valley of the Gods:  

It is said that even the powers must cavort and amuse themselves once in a great while.  Far to the north of the Spine of the World is the Valley of the Gods.  A paradise unequaled on this world or in the planes, this playground of the gods is not meant for mortals.  Any mortal who reaches the Valley becomes a deity, for only deities may exist in the Valley.  Far too many mortals with delusions of grandeur have thrown away the pleasures of this side of the Spine and their kingdoms in this world, only to break their backs searching for the legendary Valley of the Gods.  
~
@13184 = ~History of the Vast:  

Two millennia ago the Vast was Vastar, the orcish lands. These were the breeding grounds of the goblin hordes that would spill eastward and cross the Dragon Reach in ramshackle boats to raid the elves. The orcs were overthrown by invading dwarves, who established the Realm of the Glimmering Swords. It was during this time that the first humans came to the Vast, including the mage Maskyr. 

The rule of the dwarves occurred against a backdrop of constant war with the orcs, such that there were perhaps only 40 years of true peace for the Realm of the Glimmering Swords. The dwarves were overrun by the orcs, and they escaped extinction only through the aid of human and elven allies. The remaining dwarves left the region to the newly arriving humans and retreated to the east, to the south, and to isolated and hidden communities within the Vast. 

The most successful of the humans were the adventurers whose hunger was sated by gold and whose thirst was slaked by great deeds. This was the Time of the Glorious Fools, and there are those who will argue that it is still that age, as adventurers still rule the cities of Calaunt and Ravens Bluff. The orcs today are contained, if not conquered, and trade has grown up in the lands of the Vast. However, for many individuals with adventuring blood, it is still a wilderness in which one may prove one's worth. 
~
@13185 = ~History of the Western Heartlands:

The history of the Western Heartlands is a history of endless battles and destroyed empires. In ancient times these were the lands of the Fallen Kingdom of Illefarn, the Lost Kingdom of Man, and rumored Netheril. In more recent history, the land has been fertilized with blood and bone as forces from the Empires of the Sands surged northward, the evil peoples within Dragonspear and the Goblin Marches spilled forth, and mercenary companies moved to and fro in the service of one petty warlord after another. Recent battles leveled the Way Inn and threatened Daggerford. Even the Time of Troubles did not leave this desolate land unmarked - Bhaal himself perished at Boareskyr Bridge, and the waters it passes over have remained poisoned to this day.

The cities of the Western Heartlands are strong, independent, and varied. They are also strongly motivated by trade, and listen harder to the ringing of gold than the call of battle. But something else prospers in the open land - freedom and opportunity. No nation lays claim on the Western Heartlands to land beyond that which their armies can control, and no warlord can make demands beyond the swing of his axe. Small holds and castles regularly spring up, only to be knocked down by invading forces, or abandoned after a generation or two. Lost dungeons and secret citadels lie scattered throughout the land, and this rugged frontier presents more than enough opportunities for adventurers.~
@13186 = ~History of the Zhentarim, Two Zhents' Worth:  

Much confusion exists in the Realms regarding Zhentil Keep and the (not-so) secret society known as the Black Network or Zhentarim.  The two are closely tied, such that a speaker may refer to one when meaning the other and still be clearly understood.  In general, both mean trouble.

Zhentil Keep is a walled, independent city on the western shores of the Moonsea.  It is one of the most evil cities in the Realms, a blight on the North, and a haven for Evil groups, plotting manipulators, dark religions, and foul practices.  Its rulers seek to dominate the lands around it, including the Dragonspine Mountains, Yulash, Voonlar, and the neighboring Dales.  The city of Zhentil Keep and its armies (known as the Zhentilar, to make matters more confusing) have destroyed Teshendale, come close to destroying Daggerdale, and for a long time had an agent ruling Shadowdale.  

The Zhentarim is an organization of evil priests, wizards, and inhuman creatures bent on controlling all the trade and power between the Sword Coast (meaning Baldur's Gate and Waterdeep) and the Moonsea (including the intervening lands of Cormyr and Anauroch).  Its aims in the Moonsea area are the same as Zhentil Keep's, and the two factions work hand-in-glove, often sharing the same membership.  The Zhentarim have a more far-reaching effect than Zhentil Keep, though, and have agents throughout the North.

In addition, the Zhentarim are not limited to Zhentil Keep itself, and maintain a number of fortified outposts.  Their rulership has spread with the passing years.  In addition to being the dominant force in Zhentil Keep, the Zhentarim control the Citadel of the Raven and Darkhold, two important castle complexes.  Over the years, more power has been moving away from Zhentil Keep (filled with a lot of unknown and untrustworthy flunkies) and into these more secure areas.  

Within the Dalelands area, Zhentarim smells of Zhentil Keep and vice versa, but in reality not every Keeper (yet another name for a native of Zhentil Keep) is of the Black Network, and not every agent of the Zhentarim is from Zhentil Keep.  Adventurers should watch who they trust as a result.

@13187 = ~History of Ulgarth:   

Ulgarth was settled by the great empire of Raurin, in the height of its power.  When the empire was destroyed, it endured centuries of barbarism.  Warchiefs united the country several times during this period.  They fought many skirmishes with other barbarians, particularly those in Durpar and Var the Golden.  In 202 DR, the barbarian tribes were nearly wiped out by the forces of Mulhorand.

In 348 DR, a group of outlaws, fleeing the justice of the priest-kings of Mulhorand, came to Ulgarth.  There they found a fertile, almost unoccupied land.  They settled down, and began raising children and crops.  This new society in Ulgarth gradually grew in power, while its neighbors grew apace.  But while Durpar grew as a result of its commerce and its philosophy of balance, Ulgarth concentrated on agrarian pursuits.  The Ulgarthians developed a highly structured caste system of lords and peasants.  In 1002 DR, the centuries' long skirmishes between Durpar and Ulgarth came to an end, as the two countries finally reached a balance of power.  There were too many centuries of warfare between the countries for them to completely trust each other.  With their mutual border well defended on both sides, both countries have given up on the idea of conquering the other.

Trade between the Ulgarth and the Shining Lands has become a vital factor to both nations.  Ulgarth produces many of the items that Durparians trade throughout the world.  In return, Durpar trades many exotic items to Ulgarth.  Of course, the Durparian merchants usually get the better of any trade.  The current king, Drasna the Fortunate, has continued his predecessor's policy of non-aggression with the Durparians.

@13188 = ~History of Waterdeep:  

Waterdeep was used as a trading site for trade activities between northern tribesmen and southern merchants more than two millennia ago. By 1,000 years ago, permanent farms had sprung up in the area. The first mention of a Waterdeep (not as a city, but as a collection of warlords) occurs only 400 years ago. The city was truly established as a going concern by 1032 DR, the year Ahghairon became the first Lord of Waterdeep, and the date from which Northreckoning is counted. The city grew spectacularly, such that by 1248 DR both the City of the Dead and the guilds had been developed. The guildmasters seized control soon afterwards, ushering in a period of unrest and bitter conflict known as the Guildwars. The Guildwars ended only when the two surviving guildmasters brought in their own period of misrule. It was only in 1273 DR that the present system of government (or lack thereof) was instituted. This was the year that the Magisters were established and the secret Lords of Waterdeep were firmly reestablished. Since that time, the city has continued to grow and prosper. Humankind and other races come from all over the Realms to earn hard coin in the City of Splendors. Over the years these successful merchants have set up guilds and themselves become nobility, supporting the secretive Lords of Waterdeep who police the city fairly, yet with a light hand, by means of the superb city guard (soldiers), city watch (police), and over 20 black-robed magistrates. As a result, Waterdeep is a place tolerant of different races, religions, and lifestyles. This in turn has encouraged commerce, and Waterdeep has grown into a huge, eclectic city. 
~
@13189 = ~History of Waterdeep -  Age 0, Tuabemoots and Pioneers:  

Few now know the true history of this great city, which had its beginnings over a thousand years ago, when the North was truly what Southerners still sneeringly call it: "the Savage North." In those days, most of the North was covered with vast, tall forests of ancient green, and inhabited by dwarves and goblinkind (in the most northern mountains and foothills) and elves (in widely scattered forest enclaves everywhere else). A few primitive human tribes lived along the Sword Coast, fishing, hunting and gathering in spring and fall to trade their furs with vessels sailing in from the south for merchant's jewelry, metal tools, and the occasionally-available weapon or two.  In the spring, these vessels came primarily to cut and take huge trees for shipbuilding, trees being no longer available in such large sizes farther south.

In the fall, the vessels came in to cut timber for their own repairs, or to take on a cargo of wood if the misfortunes of trading had left their holds low or empty. Most of these trademoots were at a certain place where there was a great natural deepwater harbor, protected from the sea by a rocky spur of land, an arm of an isolated coastal crag, or a rocky island beyond it. 
~
@13190 = ~History of Waterdeep -  Age I, The Rise of the Warlords:

Over the years, the forest was cut back farther and farther from the shore, and tribes began to stay most of the year there, farming the cleared land. The wiser among them claimed and controlled some of the timber in order to trade for more weaponry and tools. Such claims angered many who found the squatters rich from frequent trade, and brought attacks from land and sea, the more warlike tribes slaughtering the more sedentary settlers. Noted among these tribes was that led by Nimoar, a chieftain who ordered his people to seize the farms, crude wooden docks, trading sheds, and storage barns built up around the bay. They settled there themselves, and erected a log palisade within an earthen embankment to protect the holdings.  After several abortive pirate and tribal raids, Nimoar's people thrived in their new home, a fledgling town referred to as "the town of Water-deep."

Farther north, orc tribes had outgrown their mountain strongholds. Attempts to expand underground met with fierce dwarven resistance (although many small gnomish colonies were overwhelmed and wiped out), and the orcs spread out on the surface of the land, coming south and down out of the mountains, hurling their seemingly endless numbers against all who stood in their path. Here and there elven enclaves held out, but the push southward displaced many other northern inhabitants, including the "everlasting ones" (trolls), who came down into the newly-cleared lands northeast of Nimoar's Hold, those lands now known as the Trollmoors.  Nimoar died of old age during this time of increasing danger. Younger War Lords led the men of Waterdeep (for so the ship-captains called the harbor) in battles against the trolls. There were many bloody struggles between men and trolls for a decade, until the magic of a Northern youth named Ahghairon turned the fortunes of war against the trolls, and the "everlasting ones" were destroyed or scattered. Ahghairon rose slowly in skill and power with the passage of years, until he became a great mage. He discovered a supply of potions of longevity (or learned the art of making such), for he lived on, still physically a man in his prime, for decade upon decade.

Fearing further attacks, the men of Waterdeep raised a small keep on the slopes of Mount Waterdeep above their farms, where fire arrows from on high could defend against attacking trolls. Many outlying tribes who had come to the settlement for safety from the trolls stayed, and expanded the walls with new farms several times. War Lords ruled the Free City of Waterdeep, holding it independent and increasingly wealthy as years passed.~
@13191 = ~History of Waterdeep -  Age III, The Bloody Reign of the Guildmasters:

There was great turmoil in the City as the Guildmasters argued amongst themselves as to who should govern the City, and more than one merchant of power was found murdered. Groups of liveried bodyguards appeared openly armed on the streets, accompanying their masters, and two very troubled months passed as they bickered and parleyed (and occasionally dueled in the streets). At last, they decided that all Masters should rule Waterdeep together, in a council.  The lesser nobles and many townsfolk protested, saying that the Lords ruled by right and by the people's consent.  The Guildmasters, however, said that the Lords had not been seen since Ahghairon's death, and that they must have been golems or zombies, controlled by Ahghairon to conceal his lone rule -- and indeed, the Lords were silent and unseen, and continued to be so.

In truth, the Lords were real men and women whose identities had been compromised, over the years, by certain curious Guildmasters who had ordered them slain by their own closemouthed, loyal servants following Ahghairon's death. The only Lords still surviving (those who had remained secret) were Baeron, a woodworker, and Shilam, an apprentice wizard. These surviving Lords kept very quiet, and waited. The Guildmasters thought all the living Lords of the City had been eliminated, and took firm rule over Waterdeep.

The Guildmasters ruled Waterdeep for only six years ere their self-interested squabbling led to bloodshed. Open quarrels and a few murders quickly erupted into a brief but vicious series of street fights and midnight attacks. This strife, ofttimes termed "the Guildwars" by sages (although it was never as long-drawn-out or so formal as to be called a "war" when it was taking place), left all but two Guildmasters dead, most of the City's best minds stilled, and much of the City's gold wasted or plundered with the Guilds in disarray.

The surviving Guildmasters were Lhorar Gildeggh of the Shipwrights and Ehlemm Zoar of the Gemcutters. These two - ruthless manipulators both - were well-matched and could not overcome each other, though their private armies clashed often in the streets. At length, they sickened of bloodshed, after many from both families were dead in the gutters, and agreed to rule together. Two thrones were set up in Castle Waterdeep, and from then the two argued bitterly over this and that, and the City was a place of tension and fear. All matters, including the recognition of new Guildmasters to rule the "headless" guilds, had to come before the Two Lords Magister, as Lhorar and Ehlemm were called. Few matters were settled.~
@13192 = ~History of Waterdeep - Age II, The Lords' Rule Begins:  

In his 112th winter, Ahghairon had a sharp disagreement with Raurlor, who was then Warlord of Waterdeep. Raurlor wanted to use Waterdeep's acquired wealth and strength-of-arms to create a Northern empire, with Waterdeep its capital (and Raurlor its ruler), and gathered armies for the purpose. Ahghairon defied him before all the people, and Raurlor ordered the mage to be chained. Ahghairon magically struck aside all who sought to lay hands on him. In a fury Raurlor struck at the mage with his own blade. Ahghairon rose into the air, just out of reach, and, as the infuriated Warlord slashed repeatedly at his rising feet, gestured. Raurlor's blade transmuted in his hand, from steel into a hissing serpent, which promptly bit him. The Warlord died of the venom before the shocked people assembled there. Ahghairon then gathered all the captains of Waterdeep's army, and all the seniors of the families of Waterdeep. While runners sought to bring them to the Castle, flames roared and crackled in the Warlord's empty chair-of-state at Ahghairon's bidding, so that no one sat there. Then at a gesture from the mage, the flames were gone as though they had never been, leaving the chair unmarked. Ahghairon seated himself, then, and proclaimed himself the first Lord of Waterdeep, saying that henceforth wisdom and not armed might would rule in the city. He would gather some few - in secret - to rule as Lords with him, masked and disguised when they appeared to the people, but equal to him in authority and free of coercion by any, himself included. These Lords were to be drawn from all walks of life in the city, and could serve as long as they wished. 

The people heard, and agreed, and for the next two hundred years, Ahghairon ruled Waterdeep with his unknown fellow Lords.  Over the years, the masked Lords were a group of sometimes five, six, or seven, who appeared seldom and said little. Some whispered that they were Ahghairon's servants, or even magical automatons controlled by the Old Mage. Still, Ahghairon's justice was swift and fair, his laws good, his guardsmen polite and just as ready to help as apprehend, and the people approved. The years passed in peace and prosperity. The North was opened to humans. Roads built under Ahghairon's direction linked it together, from the ruins of "the Fallen Kingdom," which had been shattered by goblin races' attacks before men were numerous in the North, to the cities that would later become Amn. Waterdeep grew fivefold in size and wealth. From all over the Realms, folk began to come to the "Crown of the North," drawn by money - and among them came those who rob, cheat, and steal. When word of doings extending beyond simple theft to deception-in-workmanship and the appearance of many fly-by-night impostor craftsmen reached Ahghairon's ears, he called together the senior merchants, "the Noble Ones," and suggested that they form guilds as was done in the far South to police the unscrupulous of their own professions. Some resisted, or were furious, but most saw the advantages of such an arrangement, particularly if they were free to set matters up themselves, and not have less favorable arrangements forced upon them. The Guilds were created forthwith.  Twice more the city walls were expanded, as Waterdeep continued to grow in size and prosperity.   Its merchants traveled the world over, bringing back exotic goods from afar, and spreading word of the city's wealth to remote lands. In the South, some listened with an eye to conquest or at least plunder, but swords were already out in those southern lands in a time of widespread strife, and no invaders came. 

Ahghairon's health eventually failed and he died. He was buried with ceremony in his tower, which was secured against thieves and fools. Those who learned the arts arcane from the Old Mage cast the most potent protective magics known upon his home and resting-place (which, many believe, remains inviolate today).

@13193 = ~History of Waterdeep - Age IV, The Return of the Lords:

One day to the Courts of the Lord Magister came two people masked and robed as the Lords of Waterdeep of old. Where they came from no one knew, but they appeared in the Castle's Great Hall where the Courts were, and commanded the Lords Magister to leave the city forthwith. Laughing, the Lords Magister refused, whereupon the shorter of the masked intruders (the lady Shilam, apprentice to Ahghairon and his undeclared heir as first Lord of the City) blasted them with lightning and fire, and their very thrones were shattered and toppled.

The taller of the two intruders (Baeron) then called for the heads of the noble houses to come to them, or leave the city forthwith and forever, if they cared not to come by nightfall. All in the Courts heard, and the news was cried in the streets.

The surviving nobles came, reluctantly and with bodyguards, expecting such a summons to be a trap. Baeron spoke to them and the crowd of curious townsfolk that had also come, saying, "this must not happen again." If Waterdeep was to be safe once more, he told them, all must support what he and his fellow Lord now planned, as they had supported Ahghairon in the past. The two would choose others to be Lords as before, he said, and they would rule in secret, as before - save for himself. He removed his mask, and said, "I am Baeron. I would be Lord as Ahghairon was before. I would be safe in this my city again." And the folk of Waterdeep there agreed. Shilarn, still masked, commanded that the houses of the Two Lords Magister be Outcast. There was protest, and she raised her hands that had blasted the thrones, and it was still again. And the house of Gildeggh and of Zoar were outcast.

Peace returned to the city, and Waterdhavians to their labors. To inhibit discovery of who the Lords were, Baeron selected certain men of character whom he knew well, and appointed them Magisters ("Black Robes," they were soon called, from their robes of office) under the Lords, to judge and apply the laws of Waterdeep in daily affairs. These Magisters he paid well, to raise them from temptation, and gave lodgings to those who feared for safety to dwell among the people. To so serve, he told the city, was a burden, not a proud misuse of authority, and if any wished to no longer serve, or were found wanting, they were not to be vilified, but accorded respect. And over the Magisters the Lords sat in their Court, to correct and overrule the judgments of the Magisters. Baeron told the people that none were to decry or belittle any judgments of Magisters that the Lord saw fit to alter or cast aside. If any thought ill of the offices or those who held them they could turn back to the rule of sword and whim, and perish as had those before them. Before the Lord's Court Baeron encouraged people to speak freely for the length of a short candle's burning, without fear of chastisement or reproach from the Lords for anything said, as long as they spoke openly and answered questions or opposing views put to them by any there. Thus, he held, just grievances of folk would be heard, no matter how small the matter or lowly the speaker. And so it was. Slow to take hold, until people knew it for careful justice, but enduring beyond Baeron's time, and beyond Shilarn's time, and beyond the time of their daughter Lhestyn "The Masked Lady," who wed Zelphar Arunsun of Neverwinter, and was mother to Khelben "Blackstaff' Arunsun, a Lord of Waterdeep today, who knows the secrets of long years as Ahghairon did. And as the years have passed, Waterdeep has grown in size and variety, flourishing with good trade under the tolerance and protection of strong defenders and good government. The years passed not without troubles, varying from the Godswar (when Waterdeep played host to gods dying and ascending) to such occurrences as a green dragon assailing the Field of Triumph (part of a plot by the Knights of the Shield to overthrow the Lords' Rule), but the city and her peoples survived and prevailed against all strife. The Lords' Alliance provides continued safety for all the settlements of the northern Sword Coast and those inland, with Waterdeep as the heart of the alliance. Though it can be matched in size or commerce, there is no city the Realms over that compares to the sheer variety of life and experiences found in fair Waterdeep, Crown of the North.~

@13991 = ~Bonedancers?  That would make them priests of Myrkul, Lord of the Dead.  The Bonedancers' duty lies in raising undead guardians - especially for tombs they don't wish defiled.  I imagine Kresselack's tomb is well-guarded by undead.    ~
@13992 = ~Look, if you're making your way to the Vale to try and help us here in Kuldahar, there's no reason you shouldn't be outfitted properly, especially if you'll be facing anything these...

This spell creates four grenade-like missiles in the priest's inventory that can be hurled at any target up to 40 yards away.

The pool churns and swirls. Strange lights dance within. As you stare at the pool you catch a glimpse of a cityscape. For a brief moment, with absolute clarity, you watch as the city changes. Ages pass and the inhabitants drop their primitive tools and ways. Discoveries are made and the minds of the people change and grow, everyday grasping a new fact or invention. The image slips away until you see only a pool.~

Again, the pool clears. Life within the seas becomes a savage fight for survival. A creature seeks safety on land. It is merely the first. These pioneers grow and change, from giant lizards to tiny insects, they change, and the world with them.

The churning pool clears for a moment. You see a man walk by, filthy and primitive. From a pouch of uncured skin of some nameless animal, he pulls a stick, held taut and bowed with a piece of dried sinew. He wraps the sinew about another stick and runs it from side to side, spinning the stick through a pile of tinder. Wisps of smoke rise and the man blows carefully. Soon he has a merry blaze. He grins, displaying a row of rotted and missing teeth. With the fire, he shall harden a spear. With the spear, he shall kill his brother. With his brother dead, he shall have a cave and a wife. The grin widens as the vision slowly fades. The pool is again still.~

I must admit, I too would take up the arms should my name be called to protect those around me, but until that day, I feel myself far more resourceful creating the weapons than wielding them.

In honor of our new marvel, I have created a special blade that I will place with the other items commissioned for the monument receptacle.  Should the day come the our way of life is defended by a sole survivor, he will fight with the will of many knowing that I have provided him with weapon worthy of such an honor.  May this blade never be wielded, and if one day it is, may it server its owner well.~

With some stroke of luck or higher intervention, I was able to avoid the attention of that dreadful lich on my last trip across, but upon inspection of the forge I was able to locate the receptacle.  It seems likely that the monument will need to be restored to its original working state before the container's whereabouts could be determined, but I have been unable to locate anything remotely resembling a switch, lever or the like that would activate it.  I can only assume that the lich is responsible, and as long as he is present within these chambers I will be unable to find the key, and unable to escape.  I have found powerful magics within these tombs, but even if by some amazing stroke of luck I was able to dispatch the foul creature, he undoubtedly hidden his life force container beyond these walls.  Without its destruction, his absence from this world is purely temporary, and upon returning I do not dare dwell on the horrible fate that would be stalking me.~

One of the so-called "Ten-Towns" of Icewind Dale, the tiny community is hardly a town, but rather a collection of ramshackle huts crowded together upon the icy shores of Lac Dinneshere.

@14561 = ~Journal of Evayne~
@14562 = ~  The last few weeks have been a blur but I will recount as best as I can.

  Arriving at Dorn's Deep in the middle of the night did not lead to a warm welcome by the dwarves, especially with what had come to past between both our races.  As expected, the dwarves were very apprehensive to what I had to say.  There were too many fresh and open wounds between both our people.  Situations like this are never easy but I consider myself as good a diplomat as father, perhaps better.
  Each day spent in council did not end until late evening and always in pure exhaustion.  We argued and bickered over the recent past events.  Although we still continued to spend countless hours in council, the dwarves began to trust that I hid no maliciousness behind my words.  The dwarves agreed to a treaty in the name of the greater good for both our races later that week.  I had been successful in my part.  I saw hope for the first time in many months.
  The only thing left was to return home and convince my own people that this was our only chance at true salvation.  The hardest part would be to convince father but he will listen.  He must listen; else let our people face death.
  The next morning almost made the last few weeks' work in vain.  A dwarven scout arrived and told of the largest orcish army he had ever seen was only hours away.  With little time to prepare, our defenses were overrun and the orcs began to pour into Dorn's Deep.
  We began our retreat into the Dorn's Deep's Deep.   Key passages were collapsed to cover our movements and buy us time.  Even in such dire conditions, this allowed the dwarves to control when and where we would fight.  Every battle cost the orcs dearly as the dwarves fought on their terms but we were still being driven farther and farther back.  Even now, we make preparations to retreat further into Wyrm's Tooth Glacier.
  Even as grim as this sounds, I still hold hope.  Hope that I will tell father of how I fought side by side with our dwarven friends as in days of old.  Hope that he will hear the tales of the dwarves who sacrificed their lives so that I may return home someday to reunite both our people.  Hope to see my father's stubborn face once again.

For my people and the Seldarine's Hand,

Unicorns are herbivores, living on tender leaves and grasses.  Their only enemies are griffons and those creatures that destroy forests, in particular red dragons and orcs.
The life span of unicorns has never been recorded but is known to surpass 1,000 years.  They are believed to maintain their youth until death is only weeks away.  The secret to this longevity is the strong magical nature of the horn.  Unicorn horns are maliciously  sought after, since possession of one is a sovereign remedy against all poisons.

Stationed atop Sheverash Tower are the proud hippogriffs of the Seldarine's Hand.  Along with their riders, these mounts serve primarily as scouts but are sometimes used for missions requiring the utmost of speed.  
Both rider and mount are trained rigorously to work as a team.  Upon hatching, hippogriffs are domesticated to be used as mounts.  They are trained in what to eat, various combat routines involving aerial and ground attacks, and to respond to the commands of its rider.  The riders are educated in the ways of grooming and caring for its mount, how to work effectively with his hippogriff, and also in the ways of aerial and ground combat.
  As a unit, they have proven excellent aerial support in our ground battles and are a proud symbol of the Seldarine.

Pelham eventually enchanted Owain's Lullabye for the bard in exchange for a small sum of money.  Owain rarely used the instrument in battle, typically employing it when he found late-migrating geese lounging on a lake.  He would blow the horn in such a way that the geese heard it as the sound of their cousins heading south for the winter.  As the geese would attempt to take flight, Owain's horn would freeze them in mid-stroke, where he would leave them to die.

@15880 = ~Within these hallowed halls of knowledge your story begins.  You have spent most of your 20 years of life within this keep's austere walls, under the tutelage of the sage Gorion.  Acting as your father, he has raised you on a thousand tales of heroes and monsters, lovers and infidels, battles and tragedies. However, one story was always left untold: that of your true heritage.  You have been told that you are an orphan, but your past is largely unknown.~ [INTRO02F]
@15881 = ~Drawn to the clamor of the forge at an early age, you have become quite skilled working for the monks of the keep, and have kept them supplied with whatever tools are occasionally required. Inspired by your foster father's tales of ironclad heroes, however, you know you would much rather swing a blade than a smithy's hammer.  One of the Watchers has been kind enough to take you under her wing, and has trained you in the basics of the deadly arts.  You yearn to leave the safe walls of your library home and venture forth along the Trade Way, a trusty weapon at your side.~
@15882 = ~Inspired by your foster father's knowledge of the magical arts, you have made especially productive use of your library home.  You have poured over the vast, if often inaccessible, treasury of magical lore, and learnt as much as you can.  Gorion has been kind enough to instruct you in the basics, but he seems a touch overly concerned about your safety.  You know, however, that experience could teach you so much more, and you yearn to travel as a journeyman mage. ~
@15883 = ~Inspired by your foster father's colorful tales of rogues and scoundrels, you have spent your childhood yearning for intrigue.  On the stage of your imagination, the ambling, preoccupied monks of the keep have often played the secret lords of Waterdeep, their purses ripe targets for your nimble fingers.  On more than one occasion Gorion has asked you to very tactfully return a pen or an inkwell to the pocket from which it came.  The more valuable of the keep's treasures remain impenetrable to your wiles, but you have little desire to steal from your benefactors anyway; you long for more appropriate and accessible pickings.	~
@15884 = ~Long have you marveled at the tales read to you by your foster father, many gathered from the various holy books on the shelves of Candlekeep.  The strength and power of faith inspired you, but the petty squabbles of the gods only filled you with disdain.  From this you came to understand the monks with whom you share your home, and the nature of their nondenominational beliefs.  Joining in their studies you have come to think of yourself as one of the Avowed.  Some of the brethren, perhaps responding to Gorion's subtle urging, have graciously fielded your many questions and taught you much about the meaning and role of the priesthood.~
@15885 = ~Set as they were against the sounds of the sea crashing against the rocks outside the keep, you have always been drawn to your foster father's tales of the unspoiled wilderness.  You have occasionally found exotic flowers pressed and long forgotten between the pages of tomes, and often spent long hours studying Nature's varied forms in some of the library's many journals.  It is your foremost wish that someday you will leave the sterile walls of Candlekeep, and worship the Earthmother in her own presence.~
@15886 = ~You have long been enraptured by your foster father's countless tales, though not so much for the content as for the art of the telling.  Blessed by a world of books, you have surrounded yourself with the ancient legends and endless lore, and developed quite a skill for showmanship.  One of the cooks has become quite fond of you and, between recitations of often bawdy poems and songs, has provided you with somewhat haphazard voice instruction.  Gorion, in his kindness and wisdom, has been urging you to find another teacher before you ruin your voice for good. ~
@15887 = ~Inspired by your foster father's tales of chivalry and honor, from a young age you committed yourself to the pursuit of good and the punishment of evil.  Candlekeep is a world of many sacred and unspoken laws, and you have learned to uphold them all unquestionably. Your honesty and integrity have brought you to the attention of some of the keep's Great Readers, but as of yet none of them have had cause to call upon your services.  While the citadel sees the passage of the occasional ne'er-do-well, its regimented atmosphere rarely needs to be purged of evil. The peace of your surroundings should be comforting, but instead you find it stifling.  You know your true place is traveling the Realms, fighting evil wherever the need arises.~
@15888 = ~Inspired by your foster father's tales of adventure amidst the barrens, hills, and forests of Faerun, you have learned to appreciate the power and challenges of the wilderness.  While you cannot remember ever venturing further than the outer walls of Candlekeep, you are a welcome and frequent visitor to its stables and pens.  Much of your time is also spent atop the great towers of the citadel, where birds often seek shelter from both predators and the chill of the ocean winds.  Still, you yearn to reach beyond, deep into the meadows and forests that you behold from your lofty perch.~
@15889 = ~Inspired by your foster father's loving tales, you have always dreamt of living the life of an adventurer, traveling the land by your wits and talents alone.  The grounds of the keep were often the stage for many an imagined battle, much to the consternation of the monks that share your home.  Companions your age being somewhat of a rarity, you endured by playing every role yourself, a habit that has stayed with you as you enter into adulthood.  As Gorion used to advise you, "A little bit of everything makes a better soup."~
@15890 = ~You know little of how you came to be a ward of Gorion's, but over the years you have gleaned something of your mother's tale from his vague allusions and from the words he sometimes uttered in tear-filled sleep.

As you have no memory of her, nor any keepsakes to remind you of her existence, you have come to believe that she died while giving birth to you.

'The carrion crawler is a scavenger of subterranean areas, feeding primarily upon carrion.  When such food becomes scarce, however, it will attack and kill living creatures.  
'The crawler looks like a cross between a giant green cutworm and a cephalopod.  Like so many other hybrid monsters, the carrion crawler may well be the result of genetic experimentation by a mad, evil wizard.  
'The monster's head is covered with a tough hide, but the body of the carrion crawler is not well protected.  The monster is accompanied by a rank, fetid odor which often gives warning of its approach.

'Ettercaps are ugly bipedal creatures that get along very well with all types of giant spiders.  These creatures of low intelligence are exceedingly cruel, very cunning, and are skilled in setting traps - very deadly traps - much like the spiders that often live around them.  
'Ettercaps stand around six feet tall, even with their stooping gait and hunched shoulders.  The creatures have short, spindly legs, long arms that reach nearly to their ankles, and large pot-bellies.  The hands of ettercaps have a thumb and three long fingers that end in razor sharp claws.  Their bodies are covered by tufts of thick, wiry, black hair, and their skin is dark and thick.  Ettercap' heads are almost equine in shape, but they have large reptilian eyes, usually blood-red in color, and large fangs, one protruding downward from each side of the mouth.  The mouth itself is large and lined with very sharp teeth.  Ettercaps do not have a formal language.  They express themselves through a combination of high-pitched chittering noises, shrieks and violent actions.  
~
@15991 = ~Ghoul
'Ghouls are undead creatures, once human, who now feed on the flesh of corpses.  Although the change from human to ghoul has deranged and destroyed their minds, ghouls have a terrible cunning which enables them to hunt their prey most effectively.  
'Ghouls are vaguely recognizable as once having been human, but have become horribly disfigured by their change to ghouls.  The tongue becomes long and tough for licking marrow from cracked bones, the teeth become sharp and elongated, and the nails grow strong and sharp like claws.

@15994 = ~Gibberling 
'They come screaming, jabbering, and howling out of the night.  Dozens, maybe hundreds, of hunchbacked, naked humanoids swarm unceasingly forward. They have no thought of safety, subtlety, or strategy, leaving others with no hope of stopping their mass assault.  And then, having come and killed, the gibberlings move on randomly back into the night.'
The first impression of gibberlings is of a writhing mass of fur and flesh in the distant moonlit darkness. The pandemonium is actually a mass of pale, hunchbacked humanoids, with pointed canine ears, black manes surrounding their hideous, grinning faces. Their eyes are black, and shine with a maniacal gleam. 
~
@15995 = ~Gnoll
'Gnolls are a large, evil, hyena-like humanoids that roam about in loosely organized bands.  
'While the body of a gnoll is shaped like that of a large human, the details are those of a hyena.  They stand erect on two legs and have hands that can manipulate as well as those of any human.  They have greenish gray skin, darker near the muzzle, with a short reddish gray to dull yellow mane.
~
@15996 = ~Hobgoblin
'Hobgoblins are a fierce humanoid race that wage perpetual war with the other humanoid races.  They are intelligent, organized, and aggressive.  
'The typical hobgoblin is a burly humanoid standing 6 ' feet tall.  Their hairy hides range from dark reddish-brown to dark gray.  Their faces show dark red or red-orange skin.  Large male have blue or red noses.  Hobgoblin eyes are either yellowish or dark brown while their teeth are yellow.  Their garments tend to be brightly colored, often bold, blood red.  Any leather is always tinted black.  Hobgoblin weaponry is kept polished and repaired.  Hobgoblins have their own language and often speak with orcs, goblins, and carnivorous apes.  
~
@15997 = ~Kobold

'Kobolds are a cowardly, sadistic race of short humanoids that vigorously contest the human and demihuman races for living space and food.  They especially dislike gnomes and attack them on sight.

'Barely clearing 3 feet in height, kobolds have scaly hides that range from dark, rusty brown to a rusty black.  They smell of damp dogs and stagnant water, and they have two small horns ranging from tan to white.  Because of the kobold fondness for wearing raggedy garb of red and orange, their non-prehensile rat-like tails, and their language (which sounds like small dogs yapping), these fell creatures are often not taken seriously.  This is often a fatal mistake, for what they lack in size and strength they make up in ferocity and tenacity.~
@15998 = ~Ogre
'Ogres are big, ugly, greedy humanoids that live by ambushes, raids, and theft.  Ill-tempered and nasty, these monsters are often found serving as mercenaries in the ranks of orc tribes, evil clerics, or gnolls.  They mingle freely with giants and trolls.  Adult ogres stand 9 to 10 feet tall and weigh 300 to 350 pounds.  Their skin colors range from a dead yellow to a dull black-brown, and (rarely) a sickly violet.  Their warty bumps are often of a different color - or at least darker than their hides.  Their eyes are purple with white pupils.  Teeth and talons are orange or black.  Ogres have long, greasy hair of blackish-blue to dull dark green.  Their odor is repellent, reminiscent of curdled milk.  Dressing in poorly cured furs and animal hides, they care for their weapons and armor only reasonably well.  It is common for ogres to speak orc, troll, stone giant, and gnoll, as well as their own guttural language.  A typical ogre's life span is 90 years.

@15999 = ~Skeleton

'All skeletons are magically animated undead monsters, created as guardians or warriors by powerful evil wizards and priests.

'Skeletons appear to have no ligaments or musculature which would allow movement.  Instead, the bones are magically joined together during the casting of an animate dead spell.  Skeletons have no eyes or internal organs.

'Skeletons can be made from the bones of humans and demihumans, animals of human size or smaller, or giant humanoids like bugbears and giants.~
@16000 = ~Giant spiders
'Spiders are aggressive predators, dwelling both above and below ground.  Most are poisonous and bite prey first, because unconscious victims are easier to carry to a lair.  
'Spiders have eight legs and eight eyes.  They usually fit into two categories: web-spinners, which have bulbous abdomens and thin, sleek legs; and hunting spiders, which have smaller bodies, larger heads and fangs, and hairy bodies and legs. 
'Most giant spiders are simply much bigger versions of the web-spinning large spiders.  ~

Thieves access their skills using the icons along the bottom of their screen. "Thieving" includes Pick Lock, Pick Pocket, and Remove Trap, when used in conjunction with the appropriate targets (chests, people, and traps, respectively). "Find Traps" examines a general area, and outlines found traps in red. "Stealth" renders a thief effectively invisible until their next attack.

@16230 = ~My friend Gorion,

Please forgive the abruptness with which I now write, but time is short and there is much to be done.  What we have long feared may soon come to pass, though not in the manner foretold, and certainly not in the proper time frame.  As we both know, forecasting these events has proved increasingly difficult, leaving little option other than a leap of faith.  We have done what we can for those in thy care, but the time nears when we must step back and let matters take what course they will.  We have, perhaps, been a touch too sheltering to this point.  

Despite my desire to remain neutral in this matter, I could not, in good conscience, let events proceed without some measure of warning.  The other side will move very soon, and I urge thee to leave Candlekeep this very night, if possible.  The darkness may seem equally threatening, but a moving target is much harder to hit, regardless of how sparse the cover.  A fighting chance is all that can be asked for at this point

Should anything go awry, do not hesitate to seek aid from travelers along the way.  I do not need to remind thee that it is a dangerous land, even without our current concerns, and a party is stronger than an individual in all respects.  Should additional assistance be required, I understand that Jaheira and Khalid are currently at the Friendly Arm Inn.  They know little of what has passed, but they are ever thy friends and will no doubt help however they can.

Luck be with us all.
I'm getting too old for this.

@16782 = ~Viol of the Hollow Men~
@16783 = ~This instrument is also known as "Tallow's Violin," but that moniker is rarely spoken among musicians, as mentioning the name of Nikolai Tallow is considered bad luck.  Nikolai was born in The Vast, near High Haspur, the son of a chandler.  Because of the intermittent traffic through the region, Nikolai was introduced to many different cultures.  One of the travelers he met was an elven musician named Relev Thinriver.  Relev introduced Nikolai to the violin and taught him for several years as he wandered through the area.  Relev knew that Nikolai was an incredibly gifted child, with quick fingers, a keen mind, and a passion for all things in the world.  Relev also recognized that Nikolai was exceedingly proud and arrogant.  In spite of Nikolai's shortcomings, Relev taught him everything he knew.

After Relev was killed by a band of orcs, Nikolai began to practice on his own throughout the Vast.  Despite his travels, he always returned to the isolate peaks of his mountain birthplace.  He became famed throughout the Vast, the southern Moonsea and Sembia for his incredible talent and passionate performances.  Eventually, news of the proud young virtuoso spread to the ears of a nearby thug from Calaunt named Tremble Ghon.  When Tremble and his gang traveled through the Elvenblood Pass, they stopped at the Elf in Armor Inn and demanded a performance from Nikolai, who happened to be present and eating dinner with his father at the time.

Nikolai refused to perform for Tremble and his men.  He called them stinking oafs and attempted to leave with dignity.  Tremble assaulted Nikolai's pride by claiming that Nikolai was afraid of performing because he'd be heckled out of the inn for his incompetence.  Nikolai shot back that his skill with the violin was so great that he could raise the dead from their graves.  Satisfied with a proposed challenge, Tremble immediately grabbed Nikolai's father and stabbed him in the heart.  When a number of other villagers attempted to intervene, they were also killed by the bandits.

Tremble defiantly stood over Nikolai's dead father and said, "Where's your big mouth now, fiddle player?"  Without a word, Nikolai pulled his violin and bow out from underneath his arms and began to play a melody that none of the residents of High Haspur had ever heard before, and no one in Faerun would ever hear again.  Nikolai played with unbridled passion and fervor.  Onlookers later remarked that he appeared to be a madman, thrashing about in ways that people didn't think were possible.  At the climax of his frenzied piece, Tremble and his gang watched in horror as the souls of the men and women they had just killed rose from their corpses and dove, shrieking, at their murderers.  The bandits died horrible deaths, chilled by the shadows of their victims.  Nikolai himself continued playing, dancing through the streets and back pastures of his alpine home until every man, woman, child, and beast ever buried in the region rose from its resting place and milled about until Nikolai and his music disappeared into a far off valley, shrouded in a mysterious fog that vanished as quickly as it had appeared.

Legends say that on misty nights, the ghost of Nikolai Tallow returns to his homeland, playing a phantom violin with a host of dancing dead trailing behind him in the moonlight.

The helm served Illian well until he went hunting a great stag on Cinnaelos'Cor, an elven holiday.  When the stag leapt into a thick patch of vines and briars, Illian followed.  As Illian leapt through the tangle, the huge horns of the helm became caught, jerking his head violently.  He was found dead the next day with a broken neck.

@16976 = ~This helm was worn by the dwarven warrior Danel Silverfrost, king and martyr of the lost dwarven city-state of Silverrock.  Danel's deeds are not as well-known as those of many other heroic dwarves, but that is perhaps because his kingdom died with him.  His nation suffered heavy losses when trolls and giants attacked it over a thousand years ago in the nearly-forgotten "War of Curdling Blood."  The war between the tribes of monsters and the kingdom of Silverrock was waged over fifteen years.  Danel never attempted to flee his kingdom, seek the aid of neighboring countries, or abandon his people.  Despite the fact that many of his subjects did, indeed, flee, Danel remained in Silverrock until the very end.  Before the final battle of the terrible war, Danel told his people, "When ye see this plume on me head fall, I want ye to make sure that our people don't bow, like gold, but that they break, like iron."  

Almost as soon as the battle was joined, Danel charged to the front of the fray and leapt into the talons of a dozen trolls.  The moment his plume disappeared from sight, every man, woman, and child remaining in Silverrock poured out of the fortified caverns and dragged down as many trolls and giants as they could.  Barrels of flaming oil were dumped all over Danel's palace and the common areas of the city, consuming as many dwarves as trolls and terrible frost giants.  In the end, the monsters had achieved a Pyrrhic victory.  The dwarven city was a smoldering ruin from which little treasure, no slaves, and no food, could be taken.  Many trolls died of starvation that winter, and when they turned on their giant allies for sustenance, the entire army fell into disarray forever.

They were married shortly after.  Beldan gave the helm to an errant paladin of Lathander, who is believed to have died fighting a lich near the Battle of the Bones.

@17276 = ~The Golden Pantaloons did surely see the very beginnings of our realm; though I must press that they "saw" this formative time by their simple presence, and not through some vestigial eyes that might have erupted through a rear pocket perhaps concealing teeth and other improbable extremities. I am sure that the various owners of the pantaloons can attest to the general lack of animated digits or ocular sensors, as evidenced by the continued sanctity and privacy maintained by their respective buttocks. 
Lyric pantoums of an age long since out of print speak of "trousers that were as metal, though soft about the shanks." While it might be easy to jump to the seemingly inevitable conclusion that the trousers rose while Netheril fell, it is doubtful that the pantaloons were the garments of which they speak. One must clarify these oft-misquoted verses with knowledge of the Pantechnicon, an ancient bazaar once prized for Silver Pantalets. Fine these may have been, but golden they were not. Nickel Panties are also said to be currently available, though the dockside establishments that claim to offer these products are beyond my meager experience, and thus I can make no report.  
The purpose of the Pantaloons is as mysterious as ever, and will likely remain so until the Pantocrator himself returns, though some properties can be divined though intimate observation. The "uplifting" properties of the gusset very nearly defy gravity, shaping quite nicely both the front and rear. This improved contour would likely increase self-esteem for a wearer of either sex. I would hazard a guess, however, that this continuing self delusion might actually hamper cognitive functions, and care should be taken in the wearing of any pantaloons of golden nature.

Iols are usually cut into faceted gems to best display the stone's color change as it is viewed from different directions. Small, cut iols can be clear, but larger specimens usually contain silky inclusions of another substance such as hemitite crystals, which give the same rich golden flash of color as in sunstones.~
@17514 = ~Moonstone is an opaque, white feldspar gem polished to a bluish sheen.  Old legends say that the sight of a moonstone would cause a lycanthrope to revert to his animal form.

@17530 = ~An Emerald is a brilliant green beryl, cleaved along straight box like lines, with rectangular cutting in the finished gem.  Emeralds are often connected with health, and so are used ornamentally for such a purpose.~
@17531 = ~King's Tears are very rare and found only in the Realms where they are sometimes called frozen tears.   Clear, teardrop-shaped, smooth surfaced, and totally unbreakable so far by any means.  These stones are said to be the crystallized tears of long-dead necromancer kings.  In each gem can be seen that which the weeping king loved long ago.  Their true nature is unknown but suffice it to say that sages prize these gems above all others.~
@17532 = ~A small, shifting, rainbow-colored, iridescent gemstone.  The fluid shades of color appear almost liquid under normal sunlight, it is truly a beautiful sight to behold.  Rogue stones are extremely rare and are used for the gemjump spell, hence one of the most sought after gems in the Realms.~
@17533 = ~This cursed item was created by the wicked sorcerer Valom of the Deep.  Valom often hired lone mercenaries to collect magic item components for him.  When the unlucky sellswords came on board Valom's floating laboratory, the Dim Courser, Valom would give them the girdle as a reward for a job well done.  Once the victim would try on the girdle, Valom would kick them over the side of the boat where they would quickly drown.  Valom's luck ran out when he kicked Herred of Procampur into the Sea of Fallen Stars. Herred had a potion of water breathing and a Helm of Underwater Action with him at the time.  When the huge, seaweed-covered form of Herred emerged near the docks where Valom was resting, a local priest of Tyr immediately came to his aid.  Upon discovering what Valom had done, the priest of Tyr and three paladins attempted to capture him.  Valom killed two of the paladins, but died in the battle.  It is believed that the belt was later sold to a traveling collector who specialized in cursed clothing.

Niri Alud was a conjurer from Tethyr who loved playing chess.  He frequently traveled with chess sets on his numerous voyages.  He wanted the ability to summon allies at a moment's notice without giving away his intention.  For that reason, he created a wide variety of chess sets of different colors that would summon constructed, golem-like automatons to aid him in battle.  Almost all of Niri Alud's chess sets were lost when he was attacked by desert raiders in Calimshan.  The raiders, ignorant of the ways of magic, let most of the chess sets sink into the desert sands.  The chess sets that were taken were soon separated, pieces traveling through trade and theft over hundreds of miles.  Treasure hunters search for the pieces still.

Similar to Power Word: Silence and Power Word: Stun, Power Word: Kill is perhaps the deadliest word of power. It kills one creature with up to 60 hit points, or multiple creatures with 30 or fewer hit points, up to a maximum of 120 hit points. The hit point checks are done against the creature's current hit points, not their maximum, so it will affect extremely tough creatures that have been wounded.

@18385 = ~Let me ask you some questions, then.~
@18386 = ~I'll be on my way now.~
@18387 = ~Terikan is a wretched necromancer that came to Dorn's shortly after the strife that put an end to our community.  He was aware of the tragedy that gripped Dorn's Deep, and knew it would serve as fertile ground to continue his "research."~
@18388 = ~What was he researching?~
@18389 = ~Let me ask you some other questions.~
@18390 = ~~
@18391 = ~During the construction of the Deep, we had the misfortunate of uncovering a cavern that housed an ancient vortice from the Negative Energy plane.   Now, I don't know if some being from that plane felt our presence, or if the vortice itself was disturbed by the intrusion, but shortly thereafter undead began to appear. ~
@18392 = ~And these undead invaded Dorn's Deep?~

@18395 = ~This banner bears two symbols.  One is a diamond surrounding two hands bound with red cord.  The other is a circumscribed eye.~
@18396 = ~At first it was merely a skeleton or two, nothing we couldn't handle, but over time, we received more and more reports of undead sightings.  In the end, I don't think any of us were prepared for what would become known as the "Battle of the Dead."~
@18397 = ~How did the Battle begin?~
@18398 = ~~
@18399 = ~~
@18400 = ~One morning, our community awoke to the screams of the son of Jamoth.  He'd been playing within some of the caves near the forge and claimed he had seen a small group of skeletons.  We sent a few men down to investigate.   They returned... badly wounded.~
@18401 = ~What had they found?~
@18402 = ~~
@18403 = ~~
@18404 = ~We'll continue this later.  I must take my leave.~
@18405 = ~Hundreds of skeletons, zombies, ghouls and other undead had suddenly appeared in the vortice cave, preparing to attack the settlement.  With time working against us, we assembled our remaining soldiers and went forth to vanquish the deceased.~
@18406 = ~But hundreds of undead with even greater numbers to follow... the dwarves would have been greatly outnumbered.~
@18407 = ~~
@18408 = ~~
@18409 = ~No Dorn's dwarf would concede defeat while our community was threatened.  Our wounded began to accumulate, and many our brethren joined their attackers in spiritual unrest that day.  Just as it appeared that we might have to retreat, a miracle occurred.~
@18410 = ~A miracle?~
@18411 = ~~
@18412 = ~I cannot spare any more time for this tale.  Farewell.~
@18413 = ~From within the tides of flesh and bone emerged Jamoth, hacking at the dead around him with a fevered glee, bellowing with laughter.  With each swing of his weapon, the undead around him disintegrated, regardless of whether he struck them or not.  It was a beautiful sight to see, my friend.~
@18414 = ~So the undead fell around him just by his presence... how is that possible?~
@18415 = ~~
@18416 = ~~
@18417 = ~Jamoth, and our community, were touched by Moradin that day.  We later discovered the vortice that had brought forth the undead was somehow reversed, returning the spirits to their home within the Plane of Negative Energy.  ~
@18418 = ~Then Terikan came along.  As a necromancer, he must have heard about the vortice, correct?~
@18419 = ~~
@18420 = ~~
@18421 = ~Yes.  Once our community no longer inhabited these chambers, Terikan took up residence in the Hall of Heroes with a determination to restore the vortice.  He is convinced that if he unlocks its secrets, he will be able to manipulate other vortices throughout Faerun.~
@18422 = ~How?  It seems the energies of the vortice would kill any man that approached it.~
@18423 = ~~
@18424 = ~~
@18425 = ~Terikan is much more powerful than I.  I am fortunate I continue to inhabit these chambers with my own mind.  Once Terikan learns of any dead within these halls, he seeks to destroy their will with his necromantic arts.  Anything that lives, he slays.~
@18426 = ~I could destroy Terikan for you.~
@18427 = ~If Terikan steps in our path, he's the one who'll be slain.~
@18428 = ~~
@18429 = ~~
@18430 = ~That would not be an easy task.  You cannot destroy Terikan by striking him down.  It is his life force that sustains him, not his shell.  ~
@18431 = ~Life force?~
@18432 = ~~
@18433 = ~~
@18434 = ~Liches store their life forces within specially constructed phylacteries.  Most liches go to great lengths to protect their phylacteries, often placing them in the remote locations where no can find them, then safeguarding them with enchantments.  Terikan, however, feels his phylactery is safest close to him, and he has placed it within a crypt in the Hall of Heroes.  ~
@18435 = ~So all we have to do is reach there and destroy it?~
@18436 = ~~
@18437 = ~~
@18438 = ~The phylactery is not something that can be destroyed by common means... to destroy it, you'll need to remove it from this plane, a daunting task, to be certain.~
@18439 = ~No less daunting than the other impossibilities we've been forced to endure in coming North... how can we remove this phylactery from this plane?~
@18440 = ~What about the vortice you mentioned before?  Would that serve?~
@18441 = ~Ah, but to reach the Hall of Heroes, you will need to pass through the Tiers of the Dead, where Terikan resides.  Not only that, but the great door to the Hall of Heroes is locked, and I'm certain Terikan possesses the key.  If you defeat Terikan's physical form, make haste for the Hall of Heroes, for he will only be subdued for a short while.~
@18442 = ~I'll see what I can do.  Let me ask you another question.~
@18443 = ~Thank you for the information.  I'll be on my way now.~
@18444 = ~Two catastrophes occurred within Dorn's Deep.  The first was the destruction of our community at the hands of the orcs.  More recently, there has been the occupation of our cemetery, the Tiers of the Dead, by the necromancer Terikan.~
@18445 = ~Tell me about the destruction of your community.~
@18446 = ~~
@18447 = ~~
@18448 = ~~
@18449 = ~Throughout the history of Dorn's, we've always had to contend with the orc hordes that threatened our way of life.  However, thanks to inspired diplomacy between the leaders of our community and the elves of the Severed Hand, we forged an alliance that kept both of our homes safe from harm.  ~
@18450 = ~What happened?~
@18451 = ~I am not certain, but it was apparent, at least from our perspective, that someone was deliberately attempting to seed mistrust between the dwarven and elven communities.  When the orcs began appearing far better equipped than in times previous, the elves began to suspect that dwarven smithies were in league with the horde.  ~
@18452 = ~Why would they think you'd supply your enemies with weapons?~
@18453 = ~Not any dwarf within Dorn's Deep, I can tell you that much.  We were warriors, not betrayers.  If truth be told, I believe both communities were deceived by someone within one of our own families.  I know not who, but I hope that when that person meets their end they feel the pain of every dwarf and elf that lost their lives.  ~
@18454 = ~~
@18455 = ~I am known as Norlinor.  While alive, I served as a priest of Moradin for our church here with Dorn's Deep.  Specifically, I was given the title Artisan of the Forge, and it was my duty to maintain this place.  I died defending this temple... I did not anticipate revisiting it in the afterlife.~
@18456 = ~Why are you here now?~
@18457 = ~~
@18458 = ~Well met, Norlinor.  I'll leave you be.~
@18459 = ~The presence of Terikan, the necromancer who has taken up residence in the Tiers of the Dead, has quenched the flames that gave the forge life.  With the forge cold, the spirits of the dead have become restless, forced from their tombs into servitude for that monster.  Almost all the dead of Dorn's Deep are now enslaved to Terikan... I fear I am the only one who remains free.~
@18460 = ~What can be done?~
@18461 = ~~
@18462 = ~~
@18463 = ~Terikan's transformation into a lich has caused enough negative energy to be drawn to the area that even our forges and machines have been affected.  Perhaps destroying Terikan could bring the forge to life again.  One thing is for certain: as long as the forge remains cold, the spirits of Dorn's Deep are denied our final rest.~
@18464 = ~I'll see what I can do.  Let me ask you some other questions first.~
@18465 = ~~
@18466 = ~Certainly.  What would you like to know?~
@18467 = ~What can you tell me about Terikan?~
@18468 = ~I'd like to know more about the conflict that occurred here.~
@18469 = ~~
@18470 = ~Well met again, traveler.  How may I be of assistance? ~
@18471 = ~We are in need of aid.~
@18472 = ~What can you tell me about Terikan?~
@18473 = ~I'd like to know more about the conflict that occurred here.~
@18474 = ~~
@18475 = ~~
@18476 = ~As the hearth warms the room, so is my heart warmed knowing that my brothers will return to their rest.  We owe you much, traveler.  ~
@18477 = ~I'm glad I could help. ~
@18478 = ~If you gaze upon the forge, you will now notice the outline of a receptacle.  Within is a key to the door in the Hall of Heroes that leads to the Wyrm's Tooth glacier.  I have faith that the answers you seek will become clearer once you reach the glacier.  Thank you again, friend -- and may Moradin smile upon you.~
@18479 = ~You're welcome... rest now, Norlinor.~
@18480 = ~NULL NODE~
@18481 = ~I have nothing to say to you, defiler.  I encourage you to speak with Terikan in the room directly up the stairs.  I think you will find that you and him are of the same vein.~
@18482 = ~Actually, I disposed of that lich.~
@18483 = ~Fine.~
@18484 = ~From one vile caretaker to another.  You have helped my brothers and I, defiler, but I know it was of no inclination or yours to do so.  I assume you have some plundering to do, so I'll leave you to your trade.  ~
@18485 = ~Leave then - your preaching *was* growing tiresome.~
@18486 = ~Terikan knew no mortal man could ever master the vortice.  Shortly after his arrival in our home, he began preparing himself for the rituals necessary to become a lich.  Fortunately, Terikan must have neglected some of the proper enchantments, as the powers he wields are inferior to much of his kind.  ~
@18487 = ~If so, can you stop him?~
@18488 = ~That is where fortune favors us.  The very vortice that Terikan is studying can destroy him as well.  It lies within the Hall of Heroes, inside the tomb of  Jamoth.  Any undead being, regardless of power, is pulled back to that dreadful plane of existence upon entry into the tomb.  That is why I have never been able to enter the tomb myself.~
@18489 = ~So I would need to take the phylactery inside Jamoth's tomb to destroy Terikan?  That doesn't sound too difficult.~

@18494 = ~~
@18495 = ~~
@18496 = ~The elves felt we could not control our appetite for gold, so we were accused of providing the orcs with superior armament.  Later, the elves took their accusations a step further and accused us of arming the orcs with the intention of having them destroy the Severed Hand.~

@18928 = ~Jester's Bag of Holding~
@18929 = ~A bag of holding is an ordinary bag that has been enchanted so that the interior of the bag opens on a nondimensional space. This nondimensional space is considerably larger than the interior of the bag and allows the user to store and retrieve objects without becoming encumbered. Bags such as these are rare and are especially useful for adventurers for obvious reasons. Unfortunately, the magic on this bag is failing and any attempt to put an item into the bag fails. However, violently shaking the bag seems to cause various items to fall out of it.

STATISTICS:

When used a random object will appear in inventory.
Bag may only be used once per day.
Must have an empty inventory slot to be used.

Flaming oil is sometimes difficult to use because it takes a long time for the user to properly throw it.  Adventurers often carry oil with them to deal with trolls in the unfortunate event that they are encountered.

STATISTICS:

When thrown at a target, the glass pot breaks, spreading flaming oil over everything within a 5' radius, doing 2-16 points of fire damage.

@18932 = ~One of man's earliest weapons, dating back to the most primitive of times, the first spears were simply wooden poles or sticks sharpened at one end.  When man mastered metals, spearheads were made from iron and steel.  Having reached this end, weaponers began experimenting with different types of spear heads, thus leading to the development of certain polearm types.  This spear is slightly different though, as it has been imbued with certain magical properties.

Among the most common characteristics of all long swords is their length, which ranges from 35 inches to 47 inches.  In the latter case, the blade is known to take up 40 inches of the total length.  Most long swords have a double-edged blade and a sharp point at the tip.  Despite the tip, the long sword is designed for slashing, not thrusting.

In an effort to improve the long sword, the blade was lengthened.  Eventually, the handle had to be extended and two hands became necessary to properly swing the sword.  The primary function of two-handed swords is cleaving mounted knights and breaking up pike formations.  This one is particularly good at its job as it has been enchanted with a few magical properties.

@19267 = ~You do not dream often, but tonight the visions are vivid indeed.  Long have you walked, but now you find yourself back amidst the stones of Candlekeep.  Your former home looms before you, but the gate is closed and barred.  Over the walls there is a candle in your old room, but as the light goes out, the brick surrounding the window closes together.  The very walls conspire to keep you at bay.  

A familiar voice startles you, though it is calm and caring.  "You cannot go back this way, child.  You must go on."  Gorion forms before you, and though his image should be comforting, it seems but a shade of his living self.  He is dead in your dreams, as in life.  

The phantom of your foster father gestures towards the blackness of the wood as though it should be inviting.  Perhaps it is, in a way, but the traveling will be hard.  As you think this, a smooth and obvious path becomes clear out the corner of your eye.  It seems meant for you, pulls at your very being, and promises to quickly lead you away from the life you once led.  Perhaps this would be for the best, but it is a bit too convenient for your liking.  You do not wish to dwell upon the loss you have endured, but neither should it be forgotten.  Gorion smiles, and fades away.  

The pull becomes a push, but you turn away, steadfast in your new direction.   The way is not quite as clear, but it is sure to be interesting nonetheless.  A whisper follows as you stride away, something vestigial and sinister that you recognize, but yet have never heard.  "You will learn..."  

You don't look back.~ [DREAM1G]
@19268 = ~You do not dream often, but tonight the visions are vivid indeed.  Long have you walked, but now you find yourself back amidst the stones of Candlekeep.  Your former home looms before you, the drab walls just as you remember them.  Over the barricades you can see your old room, and you wonder if it really was as small as it appears now. 

As you stand before the keep, a familiar figure comes into view.  Gorion stands before you, but his visage is shadowy and weak.  He is dead in your dreams, as in life.  

The phantom of your foster father mutely walks towards the woods, towards supposed safety, and beckons for you to follow as he did once before.  This time you remain behind, knowing what is to come.

Before your eyes, phantoms of the past re-enact the pathetic scene that must have taken place in your absence.  Clad in armor assuredly magical, a figure strides from the darkness.  Admittedly a powerful mage in his youth, Gorion is all but helpless before the onslaught.  As he falls, the scene begins again, replaying over and over.  Each successive viewing makes the unknown warrior all the more impressive.  

As you stare at the murderer of your former mentor, one thought coalesces in your mind: you will have such power as this.  Whatever it takes, you will have all that he does, and more.  With that, a passage becomes clear through the darkened wood, and you wonder how you could have missed it.  The trees close behind you as you walk, but you are unconcerned.  The path feels right, and will assuredly give you what you seek.  It seems to promise this in a voice you know, but yet have never heard.  

The image of Gorion's death replays in your mind throughout the night.
 
You get used to it.~ [DREAM1E]
@19269 = ~You are startled out of sleep with a chill, though the night is warm and calm.  It is as though someone has walked across your grave, and for a moment you wonder if it was you.  With this thought the ground beneath you opens and you are swept into the dark.

When light returns, you do not find its presence comforting.  Before you lay the empty mines of Nashkel, cleansed by your previous passage.  You move through walls and floors alike, descending deeper and deeper, until a bloated figure comes into view.  Mulahey, in no better shape than you left him, stands motionless before you.  

Held from whatever afterlife calls it, this foul apparition has been waiting for you.  A dagger of bone hovers before it, ready for a willing hand to drive it deep.  Had this creature breath you are sure it would be hurling curses.  It waits for the kill, a death beyond death, and knows no hope.  

You turn your back on the blade, and it clatters to the floor.  Punishment enough shall find this creature in the land of the dead; you need not inflict any more upon him.  

Surprised and thankful, the visage of Mulahey hobbles forward and through you, off to whatever fate it deserves.  Perhaps for safekeeping, it leaves a part of itself behind.  It is a spark of hope that fills a space within you; a dagger-shaped hole you did not know was empty.  

There is a cry of rage from the depths, and the dagger of bone launches itself though the air, your heart its target.  You awake just as it should have struck, and the cold sweat that covers you stings your eyes.  A disapproving voice lingers in your ears, though it should have disappeared with the dream.  "You...WILL...Learn!"~ [DREAM2G]
@19270 = ~The stone tunnels of the Nashkel mines constrain your dreams tonight.  The twisting depths are more a nuisance than claustrophobic now, what with the hidden marauders dead at your feet.  Deeper you tread, chuckling over your triumph at each body you see, pausing occasionally to wipe your boots clean or check the odd kobold for coins you might have missed.  

There is a sound from below and you quickly move towards it.  A door opens and before you stands Mulahey in no better shape than you left him.  Held from whatever afterlife calls it, this specter has apparently been waiting for you. A dagger of bone hovers before it, ready for a willing hand to drive it deep.  Had this creature breath you are sure it would be hurling curses.  It waits for the kill, a death beyond death, and knows no hope.  Rightfully so.

You brush aside the quaint blade and bring your hands around the creature's neck.  A stranger's weapon simply will not suffice in this matter; you must be certain this phantom remains among the dead.  It is strange though; doomed as he is, Mulahey still looks somewhat relieved.  His visage fades within your grasp and leaves you clutching at empty air.  A puzzling turn, but of little concern.  The mine is yours once again.  

You turn to leave, but find the exit blocked.  The lone dagger has become five: a skeletal set of claws that hovers before you.  A talon extends and presses against your chest, and a hollow voice chills the air.  "You should use the tools you are given."  It traces a line of ichor on your tunic, increasing in pressure.  "Listen to what is bred in the bone."  There is a flash of motion as the claws push deep into your chest.  

You awake in an instant, the sound of morning a welcome clamor.  You are intact and, though tired, you are certainly not afraid.

Your heart is not your weak spot.~ [DREAM2E]
@19271 = ~As darkness falls, your mind drifts back to events past, and to triumphs well deserved indeed.  A fortified camp secluded and guarded from the entire coast, and it is naught but easy pickings before your guile.  All manner of bandit and brigand move about here, but you may as well be invisible amongst them. 

Your recollections are interrupted by a powerful gust of wind, lifting you high above the camp and woods both.  Your arc crests in the high morning sun, and for a moment you are as a bird, free from your duties to those below.  With unseen hands the earth reasserts her hold on you, and suddenly you feel less like a sparrow and more like a catapult stone.  

Without impact or fanfare, the ground accepts your passage and does not strike back.  In a moment all is black, and for all you know you have descended to the very core of the world.  The rock around you illuminates and a cavern slowly takes shape, though you can see no more than a few steps ahead or behind.  Stumbling forward you find yourself face to face with...yourself.  

Before you is a likeness in stone exact to the smallest detail.  A voice in the darkness accuses you, even as it seems amused.  "Such pride undeserved, great predator, when your whole being is borrowed.  Credit where it is due, and dues where payment is demanded." 

A dagger of bone flies from the blackness and strikes the statue, square.  It cracks slightly, but the pain you feel is as though you were rent asunder.

"You were made as you are," taunts the voice, "and you can also be broken."  You fall backward into the void, and do not come to rest until morning wakes you. ~ [DREAM3G]

@19273 = ~As darkness falls, your mind drifts back to events past, and to conquests well won indeed.  The feared and fabled bandits that have plagued the entire coast are as dust beneath you.  You stride through their camp ignoring their attacks, and scattering tents and bodies as you go.

@19274 = ~Tonight you dream of blood.  Not of blood on a blade or the blood on your hands, but an ichor that runs as a torrent through the Realms.  A flood that pours across the fields and forests.  An ocean that floats you to the world's edge, and threatens to cascade off into the void.  

This blood seems a frightening thing: a massive force that sweeps away all resistance.  As a whole it is a monster and it cannot be stopped.  Were it to be viewed from on high, it would seem to cover the entire world in its red-black embrace.  

You, however, do not have such a lofty perch.  From within the deluge you can see it does not move as one, but is filled with currents, eddies, and undertows.  Pockets of calm afford breathing space, whilst violent whirlpools threaten to rend limb from limb.  Ultimately it seems undirected, and lacks a driving will, a quality you have in abundance.  You may be caught within, but sufficient determination can shape what you need to survive.  There are still options open; still choices to be made. 

As the tide presses forward you steer as you wish, atop a ship called Persistence and under sails made of resolve.  

A sudden and deliberate wave puts an end to your course, and to the dream.  It would seem that the flood does have some will, and took offence to your enjoying the ride.~ [DREAM4G]

@19276 = ~You close your eyes tonight, and visions of Candlekeep swim into view. As you pass through the gates of the citadel there is a flash of memory, and you are a child of only a few seasons once more.  At your side is Gorion, gray-haired even all those years ago.  How old must he have been to age so little in the time since?  

Aged as he ever was, you still have to run to keep up with him.  He has an important meeting with Ulraunt, the Keeper of the Tomes: an important meeting about you.  Funny, you don't remember it.

As you stand outside the doors of the inner keep you can hear the shouting from within.  Gorion seldom raised his voice, though you did not care to listen to the "discussions" at your previous stops either.
  
As you trace patterns in the water of a fountain, a reflection distracts you from the argument.  A large raven has perched atop a stone wall, and stares directly at you with huge black eyes.  You stare back through the mirror of the water, and are suddenly afraid to meet the bird's gaze any other way.  It has claws for feet you think to yourself: little skeletal claws. 

The doors of the keep suddenly swing open and Ulraunt storms out.  He glances at you for a moment, but looks away as he speaks.  "You both can stay," he sneers, "but mark my words.  That child will be the death of you."  

A flash of memory once more, and Gorion walks out of the keep as he is today: dead.  You drop your gaze back to the water so as not to see.  The raven is gone, but your own image remains.  Your eyes are black, like those of a bird.  

"Like father, like child" the reflection says.

He has an important meeting with Ulraunt, the Keeper of the Tomes: an important meeting about you.  Funny, you don't remember it.

As you stand outside the doors of the inner keep you can hear the shouting from within.  Gorion is uncharacteristically loud, and seems quite irate.  You don't know why he bothers, really.  No one seems to want the two of you around.    

As you skip stones in the fountains of the courtyard, a reflection distracts you from the argument.  A large raven has perched atop a stone wall, and stares directly at you with huge black eyes.

@19279 = ~Tonight you sleep hunted by all, and wake in a dream hunted by one.
 
Tonight you are the monster everyone claims you are; the kobold scorned like a rodent; the ogre that children fear comes in the night.  The mobs and their torches now come for you, counting you among the creatures you once did hunt.  Or so someone would have you believe.

Once again you hear the voice; a voice that now makes no secret of its origins.  It speaks of destiny and nature, and of evils bred in the bone.  It says you will never be free of the mob; that they will hunt you for what you are.  Murder and death run through your heart and accepting that will supposedly give you power.  The essence of Bhaal within you cannot be ignored.

But you have not ignored it.  You realize that from the first you have fought the very blood in your veins, fought dagger and claw for each victory, and ultimately you have triumphed.  With righteous will, you have turned the dark forces within you to good purpose.  Whatever the foundation of your being, you have remade yourself in your own image.  

Amidst threats it does not yet know are empty, the voice tries to play upon your doubts, but finds none.  As you stare unwavering, the presence grows weaker and weaker.  As it fades from your mind, one warning does stand out amidst the din.  It speaks of others that will listen where you have not, others that will embrace what you have rejected, and others that will be your death.  This describes but one man, and you know of no other it could be.  He who orchestrated your fall, deceived your comrades, and deserves all that your justice shall mete upon him.  Sarevok.

His is a debt that must be paid to the whole of the Sword Coast.  You awake sure of your cause, and of what must be done.~ [DREAM6G]

The essence of Bhaal within you cannot be ignored.

It is mistaken.  You have already accepted what runs in your veins: you have accepted it and moved on.  Whatever the foundation of the blood within you, it is yours and no one else's.  If there is power to be had, then you will administer it as you see fit, and not according to the ravings of a shade long dead.  

You calmly turn your back and walk away, applying the most powerful weapon you have at your disposal: indifference.  Let the dead rattle on if they wish.  Had they the power to harm you they would have done so a dozen times over.  More tangible threats require attention.
  
The voice becomes shrill and piercing as you walk, but gradually grows weaker.  As it fades, one warning does stand out amidst the din.

His treachery will affect the Sword Coast for some time to come, but the region will eventually return to what it calls "normal."  

There has been a more permanent effect upon you, however.  

You and Sarevok shared more than you would care to know.  You were of the same blood, the same lineage, and the poison that ran through his heart has the potential to take yours as well.  You have heard the whispers of the past, as your sibling must have, but you chose to shut them out.  While it is hard to imagine the towering Sarevok as weak, despite his menacing nature he succumbed to the dark temptations that you have not.  

The whispers may yet become screams, however, and there is danger that remains real.  For you, and the rest of the Realms alike.

Would Sarevok have become a god if his plans had reached fruition?  It is unlikely.  At least, not in the manner he would have wished. Sarevok caused great suffering in the name of his father, but somehow you know that his untimely death has perhaps served the dead god more.  As you watched the essence of your sibling drain away, a horrible scenario emerged in your mind. This child; raised to madness, driven to conquest, ultimately killed by those that would righteously oppose him; his entire life was nothing more than "fuel" for the eventual rebirth of the father. Bhaal seeded the world with offspring to effect his resurrection, not his replacement. 

Certainly an appropriate way to return power to a dead Lord of Murder.~

@19328 = ~A wicked-looking dagger with a dark history, the Salamander's Tongue is prized both for its use as a weapon and its hidden magical powers.  The blade appears to be an exotic looking dagger with a kris-like wavy blade ending in two small points.  A small portion of a slimy, bright red living salamander's tongue is somehow embedded in the heart of the blade, near the grip.  It pulses and writhes randomly without intervention from the owner.  

The exact origins of the blade are unknown, but it is believed that the first owner of the weapon was a respected and feared gnomish thief and assassin from Westgate named Turlam Shallowhill.  Turlam was killed in a fight with a rival, a halfling called Deder Seven Fingers.  Deder kept the weapon as a trophy, not knowing its powers until after it was stolen by an underling, a fellow halfling named Kreshinal Blackhound.  Kreshinal fled to Selgaunt with the dagger for five years, relying on its powers to hide him from divination.  Kreshinal lost the dagger in a botched gambling scam, and was killed by Deder's agents within the month.  Deder attempted to reclaim the dagger from the Sembian criminals who had captured it.  He succeeded at routing the thieves and reclaiming his dagger, but he focused so much attention on the blade that he didn't notice that the Sembian criminals had employed a priest of Mask to infiltrate and break down his interests in Westgate.  The ensuing war between the Westgate and Selgaunt factions ended when the priest of Mask, Pieter the Feeble, made the two sides so paranoid that they ate themselves away from the inside.  Pieter grabbed the dagger when he had the opportunity and escaped to Hillsfar, confident that the unorganized demihuman supporters of the late Deder Seven Fingers wouldn't follow him to a place so hostile to their kind.

In yet another scam, Pieter sold the blade to a Mulmaster Hawk while luring other potential buyers to an auction in Hillsfar.  Pieter and his associates murdered the buyers at the fake auction and made off with the cash, hiding under the cover of an Amulet of Non-Detection.  The Mulmaster Hawk who purchased the blade was supposedly killed by priestesses of Umberlee who were angry at the assassin's refusal to pay tribute to the Bitch Queen.  Years of factional fighting between the Umberlants are believed to have transported the blade as much as three thousand miles away from its humble beginnings in Sembia.  The whereabouts of Pieter the Feeble and his goons are currently unknown.

When this balance is disrupted, then nature, and all those that live within its bounds, is harmed.  So taught the elder druids, and you have taken their teachings to heart. 

You are but a new initiate of nature, yet of late, something has disturbed you.  It started not long ago with a strange scent upon the air, carrying the hint of storms that should not be, and flocks of birds from the northern reaches, migrating south earlier than is custom.  Even the earth itself began whispering to you in the night, telling of evil creatures stirring within its depths.  Something is wrong, and the source of the disturbances seems to lie somewhere in the North.  You have taken it upon yourself to travel to the Spine of the World and find the meaning behind these disturbances to the balance, and to see if they portend some greater evil within the region.  Nature must be protected, and the balance must be restored. ~
@19422 = ~Less than a fortnight after your initiation ceremony into the clergy, you were summoned before the head of your temple.  In a cordial, if somewhat cold meeting with the high priest, you were assigned your first duty as a full member of the temple: to make a pilgrimage to the North and see if you could spread the faith to the frontier towns.  Almost as an afterthought, the high priest informed you of his "concerns" over portents and omens concerning events transpiring in the North, and it was the belief of the temple that a representative of their interests there might serve to soothe potential troubles in the region.

Though these pilgrimages are often considered an unwanted duty by the more politically minded clergymen of your order, you found yourself eager to accept the task.  It seemed to be a chance to bring enlightenment to the people of the North, a chance to do some good rather than falling in a routine and simply presiding over the usual services within the temple.  Without hesitation, you agreed to make the pilgrimage, and within a ten-day, you embarked on your journey North, with only a staff in hand and the doctrines of your faith firmly etched in your mind. ~
@19423 = ~Although the life of a warrior has always held your heart, the huge cities and bustling crowds of southern Faerun has made you restless.  You have tired of following the orders of too many career-minded officers that seek office rather than success on the battlefield, and become irritated by the presence of so many soldiers upon the streets looking for work, that it seemed oftentimes you couldn't swing a blade on a street without hitting a newly-formed mercenary company.  Perhaps it was for this reason you chose to head to the North, where the untamed wilderness would be a better place to seek one's fortune, and the lands themselves had yet to be broken by the passage of man and the slow creep of civilization.  Perhaps in the shadow of the Spine of the World, you can find the adventure and glory you seek, and a chance to carve a name for yourself in the snow-covered lands. ~
@19424 = ~This room is dominated by mineral deposits and crystals. It seems to be a natural cavern that this strange prison has been built around. The air holds an aura of power and several pools with swirling lights grace the edge of the rough cavern.~
@19425 = ~There comes a time, even early in one's career, where one must seek inspiration... and it has become clear to you that to look for it in the more civilized regions of Faerun will only serve to kill your artistic spirit.  You have heard too many versions of the same tune, the same chords, a slight spin on a phrase or a rhyme, and in the end, you have come to believe that it is the sheer number of artists feeding upon each other's works has led to a certain stagnation.  You cannot bear one more ballad around the fire in an inn's common room nor competing with your fellow minstrels in the crowded taverns to the south - you need to go in search of new tales and songs, seek out new composers and artists.  It is this that has driven you to the North.  Perhaps your travels in the wilderness will shake the dust from your soul... perhaps even draw you into fantastic adventures that would inspire new tales and light up the taverns of the south!  The North beckons, and with it, the promise of something new. ~
@19426 = ~This machine buzzes with electrical energy. ~
@19427 = ~Upholding all that is right and good is a crusade that knows no boundaries, nor is it confined to a nation or its borders.  It is a fight for the spirit, and you are more than a soldier of the faith - you are an example for others, and it is your duty to lift them up, show them that they can become better men and women than they are.  The road is a difficult one, but you know that valor and courage in the face of adversity carry their own rewards. 

While there are many who fight the good fight, of late, it has concerned you that there are few representatives of good upon the frontier, where civilization is slowly taking root.  In cannot be argued that there is still much that can be done within the cities and towns of Faerun, but it struck you that the North is where future battles for the soul of its people may be fought and won now, simply by providing the ideals for a new civilization, and defending all that would threaten it.  Within the shadow of the Spine of the World, perhaps you can help a growing civilization learn the virtues that guide your own life and pave the way for a nobler future for its people. ~
@19428 = ~It's a well-known saying that fortunes change.  Many people believe this, but they never seem to understand that not only do fortunes change, but they sometimes change hands as well.  You came upon this realization while you were hurriedly gathering what belongings you could carry to leave town.  Though you're relatively certain than discovering the identity of the shadowy figure behind the second-story robbery of those merchants in the inn will be difficult for the city watch, you have no doubts that the priests who found their private cache within the temple vault plundered won't hesitate to call down every divination they can to root you out.  All of these minor problems could also carry the unwanted complication of alerting the local thieves' guild -- an unsavory bunch of fellows whom you had yet to introduce yourself to -- to your presence within their territory.

So, with a heavy heart, you have left the gold-paved streets of your home, and have chosen to make a pilgrimage to the North.  Perhaps in a few years, it will be safe enough for you to return to your old haunts, but until then, you'd much rather see what the frontier towns have to offer in the way of fortune.  After all, fortunes change -- even if they do so more frequently when you're around. ~
@19429 = ~Scout, soldier, guide, hunter... these careers have long held no interest for you, and it was becoming clear that no matter how far you traveled within Faerun, escaping from these roles would be difficult.  At heart, you have always been an explorer, one willing to search out new lands and discover all that nature holds within it.  Yet it seemed that unless you moved quickly, you would become embroiled in hunting poachers and the policing of trade routes that were beginning to claim too much of your time. 

So you have set upon your path northwards, where the wilderness of the North has yet to be tamed by the passage of man, and nature still exists in its pristine state without the touch of civilization.  Within the snows and the ice lie many of nature's secrets, and they call to you, asking to be discovered.  Perhaps there you can find a measure of peace and contentment denied to you in the south. ~
@19430 = ~The study of magic opened your eyes, not just to the arcane arts, but to the world itself.  With every spell you learned in college, every scrap about magic and the arcane arts that you absorbed, you were fascinated with how each piece of information carried with it a certain history, a window into another land or the writings and mind of another practitioner of magic.  It was not long before the libraries and the halls of the college began to seem oppressive, more like mausoleums than places of learning.  You did not want to meet the fate of some of the elderly college scribes and librarians, lost within their books - you wanted to travel, see what the world held for anyone with a passion for exploration and knowledge.  You didn't want to spend your life reading of other's discoveries - you wanted to make some of your own and allow others to benefit from it. 

Shortly after graduation, you set about planning your travels.  Who knows what lost knowledge lies within the wilderness of the North, simply waiting for someone to uncover it? ~

@19448 = ~I... I'll try.~
@19449 = ~My... brother Malavon.  He placed a series of spells on me.  If I ever cross the boundaries of the palace, the first two spells will destroy my natural resistance to magic.  The third spell will extinguish my life force.~
@19450 = ~I... I spoke to him in drow.  It was wrong of me.~
@19451 = ~No!  Please, don't.  Whatever he's done, you must promise me you won't hurt him.~
@19452 = ~I should have seen it coming.  I abused Malavon constantly while he was growing up.  When Revered Brother Poquelin and his lieutenants met with my people, I slighted Marketh.  I wouldn't speak to him because he was male.  Instead, I spoke with Maiden Ilmadia.  After long discussion, our city could find no reason to ally with Poquelin.~
@19453 = ~Unlike the rest of my people, Malavon wanted to join with the Revered Brother.  I discovered this, so he abducted me and took me to Marketh for "safe keeping."  They eventually found out anyway.  Now Poquelin is planning some sort of assault on my former home.  And I... I am left here with Marketh.~
@19454 = ~Thank you.  I understand why you're here.  It has something to do with Poquelin, doesn't it?  Listen, I know this will sound crazy, but I'm sure that Marketh could be a better person somehow if he could just get out of here.~
@19455 = ~If you want to break up Poquelin's army, you'll need each of the lieutenant's badges.  Marketh has one.   They open an invisible barrier at the back of the fallen temple.

@19456 = ~H... hello again.  Did you want something?~
@19457 = ~In that case, we have nothing to talk about.  Farewell.~

@19459 = ~Now that Marketh has left, I... I suppose there's no reason for me to stay here.  I... I don't know what else to do.  I suppose I should take the potion and leave this dead palace.  Thank you for your help, and farewell.~

Eventually it was revealed that his armor was heavily enchanted at which point angry spectators threw him into the pit with a club-wielding ogre. The beast managed to break all of Karajah's bones while the armor remained as good as new..

This shield was commissioned from the finest dwarven smiths by Pellan of Tyr, a renowned paladin who was known for his unquestioning courage and total lack of common sense. Upon hearing that a red dragon was ravaging the countryside, Pellan mounted his horse and rode off to do battle. Pellan and his armor digested readily but the shield gave the dragon severe stomach cramps. He coughed it up and it lay in his treasure pile for several years until it was retrieved by Pellan's son, a paladin who knew when to sneak.
The superior craftsmanship is supplemented by a permanent lightness spell, which makes the shield very easy to yield.

Kerish

Kreg Frostbeard is dead, no thanks to you, and I now hold his badge of office.  I, Joril Frostbeard, am now numbered among the six chosen of the master! Once my plans have come to bear fruit I will have access to the master himself. You would do well to remember that from this day forward, worm.  

Also know that your lack of aid has not gone unnoticed.  Only your silence in not reporting this to the master has kept you alive.  When the time is right *I* will tell the master that I have taken my father's throne.  Until then you will remain silent or you will die.  Those walls you hide behind will not save you from my wrath. Betray me and I will crumble them about you and crush the life from you!

Joril~

As you know by now, your master and creator is gone.  Malavon, Saablic's associate, will now be handling all magical affairs in the dome north of the Artisan's District.  You are the strongest of your kind, and thus it is to you that I extend Saablic's badge of lieutenancy.  Use it as a symbol of the authority that I have loaned to you.  If ever you and the others need to have audience with me, you must bring your badge with you.  Think of it as a key -- one of six keys to a lock.  Do not lose it.

I am placing you and the other orogs in charge of defending the upper reaches of Dorn's Deep.  It is your new home.  Do with it what you wish, but always submit to my will and to the will of Ilmater.  Your nearest peer is Kreg Frostbeard in Wyrm's Tooth.  If you are in need of assistance, call upon him and his kin for aid.  Defend the stronghold with your lives, for if you survive in failure, your suffering will be monumental.

If you have trouble understanding any portion of this letter, have Adinirahc or one of the other drow mercenaries explain it to you.

In the Blood of Our Father,
RBP~

It must be firmly fastened to the forearm and the shield hand must firmly grip it at all times.  Naturally, this precludes use of the shield hand for anything but holding the body shield in place.  Strangely enough, this shield feels unusually light for its size.

Level: 3
Sphere: Plant
Range: Touch
Duration: 3 or 4 rounds (special)
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Special
This spell infects one creature the caster touches with a rapidly-spreading brown mold.  The infected creature receives a saving throw vs. spell.  If the saving throw is failed, the infection is severe and the creature takes damage as follows:

1st round: 4d6 damage
2nd round: 3d6 damage
3rd round: 2d6 damage
4th round: 1d6 damage

If the saving throw is successful, the damage is reduced:

1st round: 2d6 damage
2nd round: 1d6 damage
3rd round: 1d6 damage

Each round after the first, the nearest creature within ten feet of the victim must make a saving throw vs. spell or be infected by the mold at full strength.  This process continues until the mold fails to infect a suitable host in time.  Creatures already under the effects of the mold cannot contract it again.  The brown mold quickly dies once the spell expires.~

Range: Caster
Duration: 5 rounds
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None
This spell creates nine darts that can be used by the caster and cannot be unequipped so long as the spell is in effect.  The darts are +3, do 1d4 damage, and a creature struck by a dart must save vs. death or take another 2d6 damage and have its strength reduced by 3 for 5 rounds.  The caster's weapon proficiency with darts (or lack thereof) has no effect on the darts' chances to hit a target.~
@21466 = ~Seven Eyes (Abjuration)
Level: 7
Range: Caster
Duration: 2 turns
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None
This spell conjures forth seven magical orbs that float in a ring above the caster's head.  Each eye has a defensive and offensive ability, though once either one is used the eye will lose its power.  Any subsequent castings of Seven Eyes will fail if cast before the expiration time, whether or not any eyes remain.  The powers of each eye are described below.

Eye of the Mind - this orb protects the caster against mental attacks, such as charm, emotion, and fear.  The eye may be expended as the 1st level wizard spell Charm Person.

Eye of the Sword - this eye deflects the first physical damaging attack that strikes the caster.  The eye may be expended as the 1st level wizard spell Magic Missile (5 missiles).

Eye of the Mage - this eye absorbs one manifestation of fire, electrical, cold, or acid damage.  The eye can also be expended as the 3rd level wizard spell Lightning Bolt (4d8 damage).

Eye of Venom - this eye halts any one attack or effect that could poison the caster.  The eye can also be used to poison one creature, dealing 30 points of damage over a period of 30 seconds.

Eye of the Spirit - this eye blocks one instant-death magic attack (Death Spell, Finger of Death, Power Word Kill, Slay Living, Destruction).  The wizard may instead choose to expend the eye's power as a ray of enfeeblement, dropping a target's strength to 5, reducing its chance to hit, and the damage it deals.

Eye of Fortitude - this eye blocks one stunning, deafness, blindness, or silence effect.  It may alternatively be expended as the 4th level wizard spell, Shout.

Eye of Stone - this eye shields the caster from a single petrification attack.  It can also be used as the 3rd level wizard spell, Hold Person.

Any subsequent castings of Seven Eyes will fail if cast before the original spell expires, whether or not any eyes remain.~

Sphere: Guardian/Creation
Range: Caster
Duration: 3 rounds
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 3-foot radius
Saving Throw: None

@21468 = ~Shout (Invocation)
Level: 4
Range: Caster
Duration: Instantaneous 
Casting Time: 1 
Area of Effect: 30 feet long, 10 foot diameter
Saving Throw: 1/2
Shout grants the wizard tremendous vocal powers, allowing him to emit an ear-splitting roar from his mouth in a cone-shaped area of effect 30 feet long and 10 feet in diameter at its farthest point.  Any creature within this area is deafened for 2d6 rounds and suffers 4d6 points of damage.  A successful saving throw vs. spell negates the deafness and reduces the damage by half.~
@21469 = ~Suffocate (Alteration)
Level: 7
Range: Sight of Caster
Duration: 4 rounds
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 10-foot radius
Saving Throw: 1/2
This spell draws the breath out of all creatures within the area of effect. Creatures that do not breathe are unaffected. Suffocating creatures suffer -4 to armor class, -4 to hit, -6 to dexterity, one less attack per round, half movement rate, and take 4d8 points of damage per round. A successful saving throw negates all effects but 2d8 points of damage for one round. The effects begin to fade when the creature moves out of the area of effect, although it may take a round for a character to catch their second wind.~
@21470 = ~Great Shout (Invocation)
Level: 8
Range: Caster
Duration: Instantaneous 
Casting Time: 1 
Area of Effect: 30-feet long, 10-foot diameter
Saving Throw: 1/2
Upon uttering the Great Shout, the caster releases a stunning force from his mouth in a 30-foot long, 10-foot diameter cone.  The Great Shout is extremely taxing and dangerous to the user.  The shout drains 2d4 hit points from the caster and he/she must make a saving throw vs. spell or fall unconscious for a turn.  Creatures 5 hit dice and under caught within the Great Shout instantly die.  All other creatures within the area of effect must save vs. spells.  Those who fail the save are stunned for 2 rounds, deafened for 4 rounds, and suffer 4d12 points of damage.  Those who make the save are stunned for 1 round, deafened for 2 rounds, and suffer 2d12 points of damage.~
@21471 = ~Iron Body (Alteration)
Level: 8
Range: Caster
Duration: 2 turns
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None
This spell transforms the caster's body into living iron, granting him several powerful resistances and abilities.  While the spell is in effect, the caster is 100% resistant to electricity, 50% resistant to fire, and 25% resistant to crushing damage.  Spells that affect respiration or the physiology of the caster are ignored.  In addition, the caster's strength is raised to 25, and the caster can attack twice per round with iron fists for 2d4 points of damage + appropriate strength bonuses.  Unfortunately, the caster's movement becomes slow and awkward, setting his movement rate to 25% of his normal, and he/she cannot cast spells while Iron Body is in effect.~
@21472 = ~Whirlwind (Invocation)
Level: 6
Sphere: Invocation
Range: Sight of Caster
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special
This spell creates a small whirlwind near the caster, which the caster can direct to a location within his sight.  Once the whirlwind reaches its destination, the caster will lose control and the whirlwind will fly around randomly, harming friend and foe alike.  The caster is immune to his/her own spell, and elementals and other huge creatures are also unaffected.  If a creature is caught in the path of the whirlwind, it takes 2d8 crushing damage, 2d8 slashing damage, and must save vs. breath weapon or be stunned for 2 rounds.  Creatures with 2 hit dice or less are automatically killed by this spell.  A maximum of 8 targets may be affected, after which the whirlwind will dissipate.~
@21473 = ~Spiritual Wrath (Invocation)
Level: 6
Sphere: Combat
Range: Sight of Caster
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: 1/2
Upon completion of this spell, the priest becomes a focus of spiritual energy, which then shoots out from the caster in four directions, like lightning bolts.  The caster specifies the direction of one of the bolts and the other bolts shoot opposite and perpendicular to that direction, completing a cross-shaped pattern.  All creatures in the bolts' path take 6-42 points of magic damage, save for half.  Creatures of the same moral alignment (good, neutral, evil) as the caster are unaffected by the spell.~
@21474 = ~Mist of Eldath (Invocation)

Note that a character struck with a Destruction spell cannot be raised from the dead with a Raise Dead or Resurrection spell.~
@21478 = ~Cause Disease (Necromancy)
Level: 3
Sphere: Healing
Range: Touch
Duration: 8 hours
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.
This spell afflicts one creature the priest touches with a disease that saps the target of 5-20 points of strength.  A saving throw vs. spell will negate the effects.  This spell has no affect on undead, constructs, or extraplanar creatures.  Cause Disease cannot be cast by good characters.~
@21479 = ~Sunscorch (Invocation)
Level: 1
Sphere: Sun

The victim is allowed a saving throw vs. spell to take half damage.  Any creature struck by the ray sustains 1d6 points of damage, plus 1 point per caster level.  Undead creatures and monsters vulnerable to bright light sustain 1d6 points of damage, plus 2 points per level of the caster.  In addition to sustaining damage, victims are also blinded for 3 rounds by the spell.~
@21480 = ~Amaunator's Legacy~
@21481 = ~This shiny brass sword is extremely old, dating back at least three thousand years before Dale Reckoning.  It was created by a Netherese archmage named Pouldinus as a gift to a warrior friend.  This friend, Kalamnin, was a strict devotee of Amaunator, a harsh, unforgiving god now almost forgotten by sages.  Amaunator was the god of law and the god of the sun.  He required his servants to follow his edicts exactly.  Kalamnin did his best to observe Amaunator's laws in his travels.  The blade was lost when Kalamnin was killed in battle by dozens of nycadaemons.  The sorcerer who summoned the creatures, Ylmandi, kept the blade in his family until the fall of Netheril.

@21483 = ~This grim item was fashioned by priests of Myrkul, god of the dead.  The heavy leather belt is set with metal plates and hoops that hold human bones.  The original owner was a deadly warrior named Proud Keth.  Keth rode across battlefields without fear, smashing whoever got in his way.  On those rare occasions when he was surrounded, the belt came in handy.  Unfortunately for Keth, his opponents eventually decided to take him down using polearms and long spears.  When he was killed, his belt was buried with him.  It was only a matter of time before thieves came to Keth's grave in order to loot it.  One of the thieves sold Keth's belt to a practical mage from Urmlaspyr.  The wizard, Isanan by name, found the belt to be very useful during his travels.  When he retired, he sold the belt to a grateful priest of Myrkul named Ben-Karad.  Ben-Karad is believed to have been killed somewhere in the sewers of Waterdeep.

@21484 = ~Blood Iron~
@21485 = ~A weapon of grim reputation in the frozen north, Blood Iron was crafted by a wicked barbarian shaman named Hekedder.  He gave the sword to a cousin as a gift.  The weapon saw a good amount of use in various barbarian hands as the years went by.  Eventually, each owner found themselves hated for having the weapon in their possession.  The taint of necromancy is so deplored by the northern tribes that the cursed name of Blood Iron became common knowledge among them.  To this day, barbarians will not touch the cursed weapon and dislike even speaking of it.  It is crafted of crude, poorly worked iron and the surface of the blade is covered in gouge marks and the imprint of bad hammer strikes.  The grip is wrapped in bright red leather.

The wizard Cheston of Procampur decided to make some money when he set out to make this particular cloak for the Waukeenar priest Betrand of Suzail.  Betrand used the cloak effectively until he came up against a demonic foe that could see right through the illusion.  Betrand's body was never found, but the tattered cloak continued to work wonders for Betrand's comrade, the thief Dacon Blackwood.  Dacon eventually ran afoul of a thieves' guild in Sembia.  He was believed to have escaped their wrath by traveling to Berdusk.  How this cloak arrived at its recent resting place is unknown.

Legedain was growing old and becoming tired of his frail body.  To remedy the situation, he cast Magic Jar and forced Ilfain's spirit into a host gem.  Legedain then transferred his soul to the young elf's body and left the gem on a shelf nearby.  One hundred years later, Legedain decided to do something with it.  He created a sword for his arrogant bodyguard, Gundak, and transferred Ilfain's spirit from the host gem into the sword.  Ilfain, always highly critical in life, started telepathically criticizing Gundak in combat.  Gundak became annoyed with the sword after two weeks and he threw it into the street.  A series of warriors picked it up and discarded it after short periods of ownership.  Over time, the weapon has simply come to be known by its current name.

Debian was an eccentric adventurer, who took it upon himself to investigate every type of golem that had been reported in the realms.  In many cases, the creator of the golem would send his or her creations after Debian for his snooping.  Debian usually escaped without much personal harm.

The elf's tower was also filled with a variety of abnormal spiders.  For over a year, Caligope refused to even look at the tower.  Eventually, he decided to construct a club to deal with his fear.  The resulting weapon was named the Evil Spider Crusher of Doom.  Caligope succeeded in his quest to rob Eil-Makar blind, and he left dozens of dead spiders in his wake.

However, the large temple requires a huge body of standing soldiers to protect it from attackers and spies.  The head of the temple guard is known as the Whip of Obedience.  He used to be traditionally equipped with a magical halberd called the Icon of Power.  When the temple guards saw the Icon pass them on their rounds, they took a little more care in their duties.  Unfortunately for the Whip, a clever human thief from Elturel decided to capture the Icon as a personal challenge.  The thief, whose name is still unknown, succeeded at his task and sold the Icon to the church of Bane.  The Banites held the Icon out of contempt for the late Whip's incompetence.  Eventually, the Icon was lost when the desert temple where it was held, the Obsidian Chapel, was sacked by Bedine raiders.

Once he or she understood the flow of energy, he or she could theoretically draw power from it through spellcasting or through a "focus device."  When Giddeon's laboratory was destroyed by a colossal explosion in 1010 DR, this spear was one of the only items that survived.  The spear guides itself along natural lines of energy as it veers towards its targets.  Rarely, the spear will tap into a line of latent power and cause it to explode in a shaft of violent force.

He claimed that his mother was struck by lightning twice while she was pregnant with Inazuma - once when she learned she had conceived, and again immediately before she gave birth.  Legends say that Inazuma was born on the edge of the Fateful Coin, the mystical method by which Tymora and Beshaba decide whether a person will have good or bad luck throughout his or her life.  Sages believe that Inazuma's coin landed on edge, making him immune to the effects of weal and woe.  When he came across Kadan and his scimitar, it was only a matter of time before the Zakharan gambled his scimitar and his life into Inazuma's hands.

The flared wings of the doves form the flanges.

Alledec died in his sleep three years after completing the mace.  It was given to a traveling fighter in service of the church of Ilmater.  The fighter later passed the weapon on to a priest of Ilmater named Recken the Bold.  Recken lost the weapon when he was fighting a powerful vampire near Trollbark Forest.  Recken was eventually victorious over the vampire, but he never recovered the mace.

@21627 = ~This thick liquid is harvested and distilled from the glands of dead polar worms.  It is the substance that helps keep the huge creatures warm in the desolate north.  Drinking the liquid straight from the creature's body is almost always fatal, so alchemists attempt to distill the substance until it is relatively safe to consume.  Even in its current state, however, it can still be deadly.

@21630 = ~The Unstrung Harp~
@21631 = ~The instrument of a beatified saint of the church of Ilmater, this harp once belonged to Sephica of Ordulin.  Sephica was a bard, but she did not worship the lord of songs, Milil.  Instead, she devoted herself to performing ballads to the suffering throngs of Ilmaterians everywhere.  She was traveling with a group of Ilmaterian pilgrims when they were attacked by bandits.  The bandits killed and severely injured many of the pilgrims, and they cut the strings of Sephica's harp when she tried to soothe the injured travelers.  After the bandits had left, Sephica prayed to Ilmater for help in a time of crisis.  When she plucked at her harp strings with her eyes closed in prayer, music miraculously poured forth and healed every person who heard it.  The next day, the bandits arrived and killed Sephica for healing the pilgrims.  Though she was killed, the pilgrims kept the memory of her miracle alive.  Their community attempted to have her accepted as an Ilmaterian saint.  They succeeded in 1218 DR.

@21640 = ~Xainlaphar, a mad Red Wizard of Thay, was known for turning the skulls of his slain enemies into weapons.  His most common weapon was known as the "Flying Skull."  In essence, the item is not much different from the spell Skull Trap, but it is meant to be used offensively instead of defensively.  Xainlaphar died in 913 DR, long before he had time to use even half of his enchanted skulls.  They were claimed by his foes, a paladin and priest of Helm.  They intended to destroy the items, but at least forty were stolen by crafty thieves on the way back to Sembia.

STATISTICS:

@21641 = ~Young Rage~
@21642 = ~This axe was crafted for a powerful young barbarian warrior named Hegelfden.  He was born into the Tribe of the Elk and the shamans prophesized that he would be a powerful warrior.  Hegelfden grew up believing that he was special, important, and somehow better than those around him.  By the age of seventeen, Hegelfden was an accomplished warrior.  Huge, fast, and cunning, he was more than a match for his kinsmen.  On a journey into the Spine of the World, Hegelfden captured two dwarves that he came across in a cave.  He refused to let the two workers go until they created a magnificent axe for him.  The two dwarves reluctantly agreed, creating a stout battle axe with a keen blade and a thick handle.  When the dwarves asked to be released, Hegelfden denied their request.  He wanted to keep them as servants.  The dwarves then laid a curse upon Hegelfden.  They told him that the fruit of his abuse would be the end of him.  Hegelfden laughed at the dwarves' claim and continued on with his life.  The next day, in a battle with a rival tribe, Hegelfden went berserk with blood lust, slaying every creature he came across.  His kin, convinced that he had gone mad, cut him down where he stood.  The axe was left on the field when the warriors brought Hegelfden's body back to the camp.  When they arrived, the dwarves were nowhere to be found.

Bala was a foul-tempered prince of a gully dwarf clan, which was enslaved by a cruel elven mage in Thesk. Though Bala managed to escape the more cowardly traits of his race he was even more filthy and obnoxious than the average gully dwarf. Sickened of his enslavement, Bala crept into the mage's lair and cracked the elf's skull open. Although rumor has it that it was the dwarf's stench that overcame the mage, it was, in fact, his enchanted axe that dispelled the elf's magical defenses. It is obvious from the poor workmanship that Bala himself crafted the axe. The mystery lies in where it power originates. After a lengthy career of mage-slaying, Bala died, never having revealed his secret to those who were willing to risk a lice infestation by approaching him. Some say that the axe was powered by Bala's intense hatred of wizards. The axe gives the owner the ability to dispel magic once a day.

Level: 4
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 2 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Up to 60-foot cube
Saving Throw: Special
When this spell is cast the wizard can effect the emotional state of those around him.  The effect of this is to inflict a feeling of hopelessness upon the enemies within the visual sight of the caster.  Upon a failed save vs. spell, the effected can be seen to lay down where they stand and appear to give over all will to a higher power.  Sometimes they can be heard to exclaim things such as 'I lay down and die', or 'I'm going home'.  This will last for the duration of the spell upon which they will return to normal.

The secondary effect of this spell is to instill upon the caster the feeling of courage.  This will remove any effects of panic and restore his morale, as well as preventing the above from creeping forth into his psyche.  There is no save vs. this and it will last for the duration of the spell.  It will, however, be affected by magic resistance and other such things.~

Level: 4
Range: Sight of Caster
Duration: 7 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.
When this spell is cast, the result is a globe of shimmering force that encloses the subject creature (if it fails to successfully save vs. spell). The resilient sphere will contain its subject for the duration of the spell. The sphere is completely immune to all damage; the only method of removing the sphere is by the use of a Dispel Magic spell. Hence the creature caught inside the globe is completely safe from all attacks, but at the same time is completely unable to affect the outside world.~

Note that the Remove Curse does not remove the curse from a cursed shield, weapon, or suit of armor, although the spell typically enables the person afflicted with the cursed item to get rid of it.

Level: 4
Range: line of sight of caster  
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 4 
Area of Effect: 1 creature 
Saving Throw: Neg.
The Polymorph other spell is a powerful magic that permanently alters the form of the creature affected.  Mental attributes are not affected, and the target does not receive the special abilities of the new form.  However all physical attributes are changed to adhere to the new form.  This is a specific version of the spell in that the recipient will be transformed into a squirrel unless a save vs. petrification/polymorph is made successfully.  The transformation is instant and permanent until a dispel magic is cast successfully upon the affected creature.  The natural attacks of the new form also become available and all clothes and equipment that the target was wearing will mold into the new form. ~

@22322 = ~Polymorph Self (Alteration)
Level: 4
Range: 0
Duration: 1 turn + 3 rounds/level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: self
Saving Throw: None
When this spell is cast, the wizard is able to assume the form of another creature.  The caster also gains the physical mode of locomotion and breathing as well.  This spell does not give the new form's other abilities such as special attacks and magic, nor does it run the risk of the wizard changing personality and mentality.

When the spell is cast, for the duration of the spell the caster may transform into any of the new forms at any time, and as many times as he wishes.  The caster gains the natural attacks of the new form in some cases and may use weapons in others.  The mental attributes of the wizard remain the same, however all the physical attributes are attained from the new form.  Also, any natural protections that the new form offer are conferred to the wizard, such as the resistance to missile and blunt weapons possessed by the slime.~

@22483 = ~"Oh yes, a secret magic song," the fish said. "I will sing it to you, but in order for the magic to work, you must sing this song to a special little girl up north, and she must keep it for her own."~
@22484 = ~Was the girl me?!  Was the fish talking about *me?!*~
@22485 = ~Indeed, and listen to the song: 

    Hailee, Hailee, skipping amongst the trees 
    Keeper of secrets, whispered in the leaves 
    A secret for a secret, speak of what she sees!~
@22486 = ~Is that *my* song?~
@22487 = ~Yes, Hailee.  It is your special song, and you may keep it forever and ever.  But you can only sing it when you're at home with your parents.~

@22494 = ~What does your father say?~

@22501 = ~Purvis for one, mostly cause I wait for him to come out of his shack so I can hit him with briarcones.  Sometimes he sits in his shack cross-legged for *hours,* all still like a rock, and I have to throw stones at his door for a LONG time to get him up.~

@22511 = ~Hailee, who do you think is killing the brothers?  Would Emmerich do that? ~
@22512 = ~~
@22513 = ~~
@22514 = ~Nuh-uh.  Emmerich wouldn't hurt anyone... well, 'cept goblins and wolves when they get too close to town.  Emmerich once found me when I got lost in the woods, but I wasn't scared, uh-uh.~
@22515 = ~Hailee, who do you think is killing the brothers? ~
@22516 = ~~
@22517 = ~~
@22518 = ~Well, Purvis probably would.  He hasn't had a chance to bury anybody in a *long* time.  He must be bored.~
@22519 = ~Hmmm.  All right... Hailee, do you know anything about the barbarians? ~
@22520 = ~Maybe I'll speak to Purvis, then.  Farewell, Hailee.~

@22528 = ~A massive club, this weapon used to belong to the powerful barbarian warrior Svian of the Elk Tribe.  Svian was a grim man, tall and wiry, who was known throughout the north for his dire disposition and serious manner.  In battle, unlike his kin, he rarely became excited or panicked.  He simply held his ground and destroyed everyone that came near him.  It is said that when Svian was mortally wounded, he simply walked over to a nearby rock and sat down, never indicating that he was suffering.  It was several hours before his kinsmen realized that he was dead.

@22551 = ~Created for a wild mercenary named Bael Cooper, the Blade of Bael had a short and violent history.  Bael was the rowdy, hotheaded son of cooper, and he did all he could to get out of his small town of Soubar and head for Baldur's Gate.  When he arrived in Baldur's Gate, he hired himself out as a mercenary, thug, and caravan guard, quickly earning a reputation as an incredibly unreasonable and hot-tempered man.  Within his first six months in Baldur's Gate, he had been arrested five times and was known to have almost killed at least four different people who accidentally looked him in the eye for a moment too long.  Somehow, however, Bael attracted a small following of easily impressionable thugs who joined him on his seedy adventures.  Eventually, Bael managed to scrape together enough money to pay a wizard to craft a powerful sword for him.  The Blade of Bael aided its owner well until the mean-spirited brute decided to rough up and harass a young priestess of Eldath.  When local Tempurans heard what Bael had done, they descended on him in the street and beat him with clubs, then threw him into the bay.  They took his sword to their temple and later auctioned it off to a worthy owner.

Unknown to her lovers, she would place a Ring of Readiness on the mace, saving the matching ring for a special time.  When she grew tired of her consorts, as she always did, she would give the matching ring to a new lover and send the young man out to kill her old paramour.  The new lover would simply call upon the ring and the mace would fly to his hand.  

Unfortunately, Redani was done in when she trusted the wrong man to kill her old lover.  Gural of Chessenta, a well-disguised priest of Hoar, took it upon himself to gain vengeance for a man whose skull he had picked up by the side of a road.  Unluckily for Redani, priests of Hoar will go to any length to avenge the dead, even if it means animating all of her dead lovers to tear her limb from limb.

It is said by some that after he found the sword, quite by accident, that he was blessed with exceptional creativity and powerful sensitivity to the world around him.  He traveled for forty years and is known for some of the most unique, haunting melodies in Faerun.  It is believed that Daen eventually became too melancholy at the sights of misery and oppression that he encountered in his travels, and that the fae smiths of the Moonshae Isles welcomed him into the breast of Myrloch.

@22608 = ~Spirit Armor~
@22609 = ~Spirit Armor (Necromancy)
Level: 4
Range: Touch
Duration: 3 turns
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None
This spell is very similar to the 3rd level spell Ghost Armor in that it creates a corporeal barrier around the targets body for the duration of the spell.  This spell however, actually taps in to the targets life force in order to create the barrier.  The armor itself is weightless, and does not hinder movement or spell casting at all. The Spirit Armor does not work cumulatively with any other armor, however dexterity bonus' still apply as well as magic rings and a shield.  While in effect the AC (armor class) of the recipient will be 1, as if he was wearing plate mail.  Also, due to the magical nature of the spell, he will also receive a +3 bonus to save vs. magical attacks. There is a danger however, as when the spell runs out the external portion of the spirit is temporarily lost, inflicting 2d4 points of damage upon the target.~
@22610 = ~Chaos~
@22611 = ~Chaos (Enchantment/Charm) 
Level: 5
Range: Sight of Caster
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 5 
Area of Effect: 20-foot radius
Saving Throw: Special 
The effects of this spell are identical to the 4th level spell Confusion in all respects.  The victims wander around as if in a daze, sometimes wandering away, sometimes attacking, either friend or foe.  If the victim is 4th level or lower, he does not receive a saving throw versus the effects.  However if the victim is 5th level or higher, he receives a save vs. spell at -4.  The spell lasts for the duration or until a successful dispel magic is cast.~
@22612 = ~Feeblemind~
@22613 = ~Feeblemind (Enchantment/Charm)
Level: 5
Range: Sight of Caster
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg
This spell turns a target into a gibbering idiot, which lasts until a Dispel Magic is cast upon him.  The victim is allowed a saving throw vs. spells at -2 to resist being stupefied.  Feebleminded individuals cannot cast spells.  The priest spell Heal will remove Feeblemind from an afflicted character.~
@22614 = ~Domination~
@22615 = ~Domination
(Enchantment/Charm) 
Level: 5
Range: Sight of Caster
Duration: 12 hours
Casting Time: 5 
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg. 
The domination spell enables the caster to control the actions of any creature while the spell is in effect.  This control is maintained through a telepathic link between the caster and the victim.  Unlike the 4th level priest spell mental domination, the target has no option for release, even if made to do something against his morals, except of course a dispel magic.  The target gets a saving throw vs. spell at -2 in order to avoid the effect.~
@22616 = ~Hold Monster~
@22617 = ~Hold Monster
(Enchantment/Charm)
Level: 5
Range: Sight of Caster
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 20-foot radius
Saving Throw: Neg.
This spell holds 1-4 creatures of any type (except for undead creatures) in place unless they make a save vs. spells.  The effect is centered on a point on the ground selected by the caster, and any other creatures within 5 feet of the target has a chance to be affected as well. While paralyzed, the target is helpless and cannot defend themselves from attacks.~
@22618 = ~Mental Domination~
@22619 = ~Mental Domination 
(Enchantment/Charm) 
Level: 4
Sphere: Thought 
Range: Sight of Caster
Duration: 3 rounds/level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 1 creature 
Saving Throw: Neg.
When cast upon a subject, he must make a save vs. spell at -2 in order to avoid the priest entering his mind.  The effects of this spell are similar to the wizard spell Domination, with a few minor differences.  First this spell gives the priest no access to the subject's thoughts, memory, or sensory apparatus.  The priest simply is able to command the subject to perform certain tasks or functions during the spell duration.~
@22620 = ~Protection from Lightning~
@22621 = ~Protection From Lightning (Abjuration) 
Level: 4
Sphere: Protection, Weather
Range: Touch 
Duration: 5 rounds/level
Casting Time: 7 
Area 'of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None 
When the spell is cast it confers complete invulnerability to electrical attacks such as dragon breath or magical attacks such as Lightning Bolt, Shocking Grasp etc.  The protection will last for the duration of the spell or until successfully dispelled.~

@22695 = ~It would seem that the very speculation of this weapon's existence has conspired to pull it from the realm of fantasy and into the everyday, though, as with all things that come from dreams, it is not as it truly seems. The blade is indeed vampiric, as the name would suggest; though not in the manner the finder might have hoped. It is rumored that the blade, instead of performing as one might think a vampiric blade would, was actually constructed by vampires as a trap for those that could eventually oppose them. These incredibly clever fiends have apparently fashioned numerous versions of these unfortunate blades over time, and they are the bane of all right-thinking adventurers. Each swing actually inflicts damage upon the wielder, as his life energies are drained in order to heal his intended victim. Were this not enough, the weapon is cursed so as to prevent it's removal, and the user is smitten with a wasting of the mind, that he might not even think of trying to rid himself of it. This may be among the few magical treasures that are simply not worth the trouble of seeking, and one might better spend ones time having a lovely beverage, rather than gallivanting about the wilderness with a pack full of rubbish chasing phantoms.

@22712 = ~The long, curved, single-edged blade is characteristic of both the sabre and the scimitar, even though their origins lie in different part of Faerun.  Where as the sabre was intended mainly for horsemen, mainly due to its versatility, the scimitar has a heavier oriental influence.  The "shamshir", as it was originally called, is larger, has a greater curve to it, and is tapered to an elongated, sharp point.  The effect of this is that it is slightly slower but tends to be more effective and deadly in combat.

Although, among the barbaric humanoid masses throughout the dark forests and misty jungles of the world, hide armor is common.  Even though it does offer more protection then leather armor, one must get by the offensive odor and shoddy appearance in order to wear it effectively.

This enchanted club is said to have existed since the time of the fall of Netheril and the birth of the great Anauroch Desert. While the toll on civilization was great, the true victims were nature's creatures, condemned to stand and watch as their homes decayed and died. As habitats receded, those that remained were invaded by displaced hordes of creatures, the more impatient of which marched on unspoiled land taking whatever they wished. This particular weapon is said to have come from a dryad's tree, a final gift to nature's cause from a woodland spirit that could not hold back the invaders of her land. Hers was a bittersweet pain, as her wood might not have suffered so if it had not been so strong and lush. Less respecting scholars have since bestowed the item's ironic name, though the humor is not appreciated among nature's more devout followers.

(Enchantment/Charm) 
Level: 4
Sphere: Law
Range: Caster
Duration: 6 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 10-foot radius
Saving Throw: None
Defensive Harmony allows a group of creatures to act as a single unit for a single battle or encounter, enhancing the coordination of their attacks and tactics.  This effect is always centered on the caster but affects all those within a 10-foot radius.  The affected can move outside of this area after the spell is cast and still enjoy the benefits of harmony.  While the spell is in effect, each affected creature gains a +4 bonus to his Armor Class.  This lasts for 6 rounds or until successfully dispelled.~

(Abjuration) 
Level: 4
Sphere: Protection
Range: Touch 
Duration: 1 turn/level
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 10-foot radius
Saving Throw: None 
When this spell is cast, all creatures within a 10' radius are affected individually by Protection from Evil, giving them +2 to Armor Class, +2 to Saving Throws and immunity to all charm-based spells.~

@22834 = ~Champion's Strength (Alteration) 
Level: 5
Sphere: Law
Range: Sight of Caster
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None
When this spell is cast,the priest effectively draws on the strength of his god and lends it to the target creature, in effect creating a champion.  The target's strength is increased to 20-23 for 1 turn.  As soon as the spell is cast, the spellcaster becomes fatigued, suffering a penalty to all his/her rolls. The drawback to this spell is that the priest must concentrate on the connection between the target and his god for the duration of the spell, hence losing the ability to cast any additional spells during this time.  The effect lasts for one turn or until dispelled.~

The Sea of Swords allows your passage without incident, and in a scant amount of time you are on to truly open waters. A score or more of days pass, but the aptly named Trackless Sea seems to stretch before you without end. The waters are calm, though the wind remains steady and sure.
The merchant vessel your employer has chartered is a fine ship, but her crew is not accustomed to journeys so far off the established trade routes. The more superstitious among them speak of a great waterfall off the edge of Faerun, of a secret Elven nation that scuttles all that dare come near, or even of island-size turtles that eat whole ships. Such fancy weighs heavily on the minds of nervous sailors, and the mood aboard ship slowly turns. Tensions begin to mount, and rumors of mutiny threaten your resolve. It is a mixed blessing that all aboard are soon given a very real danger to occupy their thoughts.
The storm comes without warning, and hits with a fury that seems almost deliberate. Gale force winds toss the ship about like a cork, and it is all the crew can do to keep her afloat. Their efforts, though valiant, are ultimately futile, and when the mainmast splinters you know the ship is lost. As the hull gives way there is a glimpse of something in the distance: a steady illumination against the black of night. Grasping debris for flotation you abandon the wreck, and begin to swim under the heavy burden of your equipment. You head towards the glow, hoping it is not a sea wisp or some other nefarious trick of the eyes.
You awake the next morning with a mouth full of sand. You are waterlogged, exhausted, and you have an aching pain that lets you know you are very much alive. The ship is so much kindling, there is no sign of the crew, but there do appear to be footprints in the sand...~
@23356 = ~The journey home is mercifully without incident, though the events on the isle you left behind continue to weigh heavily on your mind. On the surface it would seem that you have succeeded in your mission, and found at least the remnants of the legendary Balduran and his fate. The cost of that information was high however, both for you and for the island's inhabitants. Aside from their missing chieftain they will never leave their island home, though likely this is for the best of all concerned. 
You have left with your life and a rich reward awaits your return to the mainland. Mendas will be waiting to hear of your triumph, and it is quite a tale you have to tell.~

Where as the sabre was intended mainly for horsemen, mainly due to its versatility, the scimitar has a heavier oriental influence.  The "shamshir", as it was originally called, is larger, has a greater curve to it, and is tapered to an elongated, sharp point.  The effect of this is that it is slightly slower but tends to be more effective and deadly in combat.  This particular weapon has been enhanced magically to compliment the skill of the wielder.

'A Lovely Bun-cake Brightens Anyone's Day'

The recipes herein are mine own imagining, and thus ingredients are subject to change as per my whim. 
************
Belladonna Bun-cake
A simple little dish for a rainy afternoon.

Cornflour, 
The eggs of a seabird, 
A spoon of the Whitecap fungus,
The fruit of your choice for sweetening, 
One small measure of the belladonna root.
Prepare as one would a breadloaf, though less time given to the rising. 
Bake in a well stoked hearth under leaves for one turn of the hourglass.

Notes to myself: Refrain from eating this ever again. Exceptionally poisonous. Remember the unfortunate week on the kitchen floor. 
************
Dradeel's Vegetable Surprise
A dish that turned out surprisingly edible. Not recommended as the primary meal every day for 300 years. Some disorientation may result.

Place 2 cups of virgin Netherise Olive Oil and 1 large chopped onion in a large pot
Saute onions in oil over medium fire until onions begin to become clear
Add 2 chopped carrots and 2 chopped stalks of celery
Saute for an additional 3 minutes
Add 1 1/2 quarts of water and bring to a boil.

Add 2 diced and peeled potatoes, 1 cup of white wine (I find that a Myth Rhynnian vintage is perfect), 1 bay leaf, 2 diced tomatoes, and chopped parsley to taste.

Cook, covered, over medium-smallish fire until vegetables are almost tender. Add 2 cups of chopped spinach and cook for an additional 15 minutes. Serve hot and garnish with grated cheese.

Note: For orcish version, replace all ingredients with turnips.

Curative Ingredients for the Dispelling of Lycanthropy. 
Mother's family recipe

Notes: Mother's topical salve is a rather large failure. Research further with the following in mind: The creatures on this isle are unusual beyond their splitting into two factions. Theirs is an odd curse, one that defies the traditional remedies (such as the unfortunately dangerous muffins previous), though one is not without hope. The exotic origin of the original stock suggest a unique enchantment, not unlike that of the more widely know vampiric afflictions. The casual bite might be averted using such things as the Belladonna flower, but an intentional infection could actually require the extermination of the leader of the clan. This is merely conjecture of course, as I have been unable to examine said leader. Despite my strange immunity, his is a strength that could still inflict a measure of serious damage upon my physical form. He and I have spoken on occasion, though his tolerance of me is no more resilient than mine is of him. 

Further notes to myself: Future offerings of peace to either of the wolf clans should not take the form of muffins of any sort.

The Bachelor's Crutch
Noodles of quality and convenience.

Ingredients:
A measure of noodles.
Boiling water
Container

Combine ingredients in container.
Enjoy. Oh yes, enjoy.

Notes to myself: Should probably be supplemented with something of nutritional value, lest my bones become brittle as chalk. Perhaps the container?~

@24242 = ~Cat's Grace (Alteration) 
Level: 2
Range: Touch 
Duration: 1 hour/level 
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None 
This spell magically increases a target's dexterity.  The amount depends on the target's class:  Thieves gain 1d8 points, Fighters and Mages gain 1d6 points, and Clerics gain 1d4 points.  Cat's Grace cannot raise a target's dexterity past 20.~
@24243 = ~Expeditious Retreat (Alteration)
Level: 1
Range: Caster
Duration: 3 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None
This spell doubles the caster's normal speed for a short period of time... usually long enough to escape.  Other movement-altering effects, such as Haste and Slow, cannot affect the caster while this spell is in effect.
~
@24244 = ~Contact Other Plane (Divination)
Level: 5
Range: Caster
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None
This spell allows the wizard to contact powers from other planes of existence in order to receive advice and information.  The nature of the divination is oriented around knowledge of powerful foes, magic items, and spells.~
@24245 = ~Vitriolic Sphere (Conjuration)
Level: 4
Range: Sight of Caster
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special
This spell conjures a sphere of glowing emerald acid that the caster can direct to strike any target within range.  When it reaches its target, the sphere explodes and drenches the victim in potent acid.  The victim suffers 1d4 points of acid damage per caster level, to a maximum of 12d4 points of damage.  After the initial damage, the victim must make a saving throw to avoid more damage.  If unsuccessful, the victim continues to suffer acid damage in the following rounds, sustaining two less dice of damage each round.  For example, an 8th-level wizard inflicts 8d4 damage with this spell on the first round, 6d4 on the second round, 4d4 on the third round, 2d4 on the fourth round, and the spell ends on the fifth round.  Each round the victim is entitled to a saving throw vs. spell to avoid further damage.  The vitriolic sphere also splashes acid in a 5-foot radius around the primary target.  Any creatures within the splash radius must save vs. polymorph/paralyzation or suffer a splash hit that inflicts 1d4 points of damage per every five levels of the caster.  Splash hits do not cause continuing damage.~
@24246 = ~Mordenkainen's Force Missiles
(Invocation)
Level: 4
Range: Sight of Caster
Duration: Instantaneous 
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special
This spell creates a brilliant globe of magical energy that streaks forth from the caster's hand to unerringly strike its target, much like a Magic Missile spell.  The wizard creates one missile at 7th level, and an additional missile at every third level after 7th - in other words, two missiles at 10th level, three at 13th, four at 16th, and so on, to a maximum of seven missiles at 25th level.  Each missile inflicts 2d4 points of damage to the target and then bursts in a 5-foot radius concussive blast that inflicts 1 point of damage per level of the caster - for example, a 12th-level wizard could conjure two force missiles, each of which strikes for 2d4+12 points of damage.  Creatures taking damage may attempt a saving throw vs. spell to negate the concussion damage, but the impact of the missile itself allows no saving throw.  The 1st level wizard spell Shield will absorb the force missiles harmlessly, including the concussion damage.~
@24247 = ~Undead Ward (Necromancy)
Level: 5
Sphere: Wards
Range: Caster
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 20-foot radius
Saving Throw: None
This spell amplifies the influence a priest has over undead, though it is tied to the area surrounding the priest where cast and does not move.  Any undead creature entering the area of effect is affected as if turned by the priest that cast this spell.  If the turning fails, the undead creature is immune to further turning attempts by the spell unless it leaves and reenters the area of effect.~
@24248 = ~Unfailing Endurance (Necromancy)
Level: 4
Sphere: Necromantic
Range: Touch
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None
This spell restores the stamina of the creature touched, bringing back the energy lost from a day and a half of exertion.  Note that this may not be sufficient to bring a character out of the "fatigued" state.~
@24249 = ~Poison (Necromancy) 
Level: 4
Sphere: Healing
Range: Touch
Duration: 20 seconds
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 1 creature

This spell grants the caster the ability to touch a creature and instantly poison them.  The poison deals 20 points of damage over 20 seconds, then dissipates from the target's body.  Poison can only be cast by evil characters.~
@24250 = ~Cloud of Pestilence (Alteration)
Level: 4
Sphere: Combat, Elemental (Air)
Range: Sight of Caster
Duration: 4 rounds
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 20-foot radius
Saving Throw: Neg.
This spell transforms the air in a 20-foot radius into sickening, grayish mists.  The caster and non-living creatures are immune to the effects of the cloud.  Every round of exposure to the disease-ridden air causes the loss of 3 points of strength and dexterity, 3 points of damage, and blindness.  These effects last 1 turn.  Cloud of Pestilence can only be cast by evil characters.~
@24251 = ~Animal Rage (Enchantment)
Level: 5
Sphere: Combat
Range: Touch
Duration: 15 rounds
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None
This spell imbues the target creature with animal ferocity. The target creature gains a strength of 19, +20 hit points, +20% movement, and +2 to all saving throws.  The target loses the ability to cast spells while Animal Rage is in effect.  He or she can be controlled normally unless enemies are within sight, at which time the target immediately attacks in melee, using whatever is in hand.  There is a 5% chance per round that the target will go berserk, attacking friend and foe alike.~
@24252 = ~Smashing Wave (Invocation)
Level: 4
Sphere: Elemental (Water)
Range: 40 feet
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 5-foot wide wave
Saving Throw: 1/2
This spell summons a wave of water that moves in the direction willed by the caster, striking all in its path with massive force.  The wave deals 4d10 points of crushing damage, and in addition, there is a 25% chance a creature struck is stunned for 2 rounds, and a 5% chance the creature is knocked unconscious.  If the creature struck makes a successful saving throw vs. breath, the damage is reduced by half and the creature avoids being stunned or knocked unconscious.~
@24253 = ~Thorn Spray (Alteration)
Level: 4
Sphere: Plant
Range: Special
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 30-foot long, 25-foot wide cone
Saving Throw: 1/2
By means of this spell, the caster can cause a spray of barbs, spikes, thorns, and spines to spring forth from his hand.  The thorn spray covers a 30-foot long, 60-foot wide cone, inflicting 2d10 points of piercing damage to all creatures within the area of effect, or 1d10 points of damage if a saving throw vs. death is successful.~
@24254 = ~Star Metal Cudgel (Conjuration)
Level: 4
Sphere: Combat
Range: Caster
Duration: 3 turns
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None
This spell creates a meteoric iron magical club that is +2 to hit and damage, and treated as a +4 weapon for purposes of what it can hit.  Proficiency, strength, and specialization bonuses and penalties apply.  It does an additional 2d6 points of crushing damage against unnatural creatures (undead, elementals, golems, outer planar creatures, etc).~
@24255 = ~Storm Shell (Abjuration)
Level: 3
Sphere: Protection, Weather
Range: Caster
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None
This spell surrounds the caster with a dark sphere of disruptive energy that moves with him.  The storm shell reduces all fire, cold, and electrical damage to the caster by 50%.~
@24256 = ~Moonblade (Invocation)
Level: 3
Sphere: Combat, Sun
Range: Caster
Duration: 2 turns
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None
This spell summons forth a silent, weightless sword-like construct made of moonlight that extends 4 feet from the caster's hand.  The moonblade is considered a +4 weapon for determining what creatures it can damage, though the bonus does not apply to THAC0.  In addition, due to the insubstantial nature of the moonblade, melee bonuses from strength do not apply.

The strike of a moonblade drains a target's vitality, inflicting 1d12+4 points of damage, and an additional 1d12 points to undead, who are particularly susceptible.  A successful strike also temporarily scrambles magic, causing any spells the target casts in the next round to fail.~

He was especially well known for his lack of fear of the undead.  He considered undead to be, in his words, "Unoriginal, tired old jokes."  "After the hundredth skeleton," he would say, "what's to be afraid of?  They all march at you like horses to water, and you just hack them down one at a time.  I'm supposed to be scared of that?"  He would wade into tombs with his trusted flail and smash apart any undead that he found, joking all the way.  Eventually, Seldon's lack of respect for the necromantic arts earned him an enemy in the form of Tiron, a lich of no small power.  Tiron captured Seldon and paralyzed him, letting a group of skeletons beat him to death.  Seldon's friends later recovered his body and had him raised from the dead.  He was not as light-hearted about the walking dead after that.

Bards sing about the various near-death experiences he escaped from in the simple, if long-winded, tune, "The One Hundred Lives of Ket the Keen."  He was also known for two of the weapons he carried.  One was his short sword, Bloodfarmer.  The other was his dagger, Reliance.  It is said that Ket kept this dagger on his person for all of his days, never turning it over to any man, nor keeping it out of arm's reach at any time.  He was actually kicked out of the Cormyrean royal court for his stubborn insistence on keeping Reliance, unbound, by his side.  After he died, Ket's extremely large family decided to donate the dagger to the church of Arvoreen.  The church later gave it to a promising young halfling warrior.  The warrior was killed later when he turned over the dagger upon entering a seemingly friendly camp.  His hosts turned out to be a pack of bandits.  They killed the poor halfling on the spot.

@24306 = ~Named for its ability to make its victims "push up daisies," this crossbow was used by renowned mage-killer Vicalet Hawkeye.  Vicalet was a half-elven mercenary who hired himself out to various adventuring companies as support.  He would trail or flank his employers in dangerous environments and shoot any and all mages that he saw.  A few mages even tried to use Projected Images to fool Vicalet, but the crafty half-elf always saw through the ruse.  Vicalet retired a rich man, and opened a vineyard for himself and his family.  He later sold his crossbow to a young, cocky human mercenary.  It is believed that the new owner was not as skilled or as crafty as Vicalet, and came to an untimely end.

@24308 = ~The Black Bow~
@24309 = ~A rough bow with a dusty appearance, the Black Bow was created as an instrument of vengeance by a Cormyrean settler in the Western Heartlands of Faerun.  A former soldier named Jonan of Suzail, after years of campaigning in the name of the crown, finally returned home to marry his childhood sweetheart.  Through all of his years in the military, he remained true to his love and saved his earnings.  He and his new wife moved west in the hopes that they would find frontier land to settle.  In the lands north of Baldur's Gate and east of the Trollbark Forest, Jonan built his home and farm.  Within five years, there were raiders in the area, and farms were being destroyed all around Jonan's.  Eventually, the raiders targeted Jonan's home, killing his wife and child and leaving him for dead.  His farm was burned to the ground.  Weeks later, Jonan crafted this bow and rubbed the ashes of his farm and family into the grain of the wood.  He later went on a murderous rampage, slaying each of the bandits where he found them, and later killing anyone they associated with.  Sages debate how the bow became enchanted, but most believe that, after Jonan's death, it was blessed by a god.  Some say it was blessed by Tyr, some say by Hoar, and others say by Bhaal.  Theories tend to revolve around whether the speaker believes Jonan's actions were just, vengeful, or murderous.

@24311 = ~The Company of the Black Snake was a moderately powerful force around Waterdeep in the first half of the 13th century, DR.  They were well known for their detailed battle tactics and organized fighting formations.  When they fought especially powerful foes, their two dwarves and two halflings would rush the front to surround their target.  The humans and elves would then strike with halberds and bows from the back ranks.  This particular halberd belonged to Bedwyn Fayr, one of the best halberdiers in the company.  The company's tactics fell apart in 1252 DR when an unknown party with superior tactics decided to take the group out.  Only Fayr and one halfling, Pep Greenfields, survived the assault.  Fayr and Pep decided that Tymora had given them a sign.  They sold their adventuring gear and opened a profitable antique shop in Waterdeep.

However, he also believed that thieves and assassins were constantly looking to steal his wealth.  To make himself appear mundane, he wore the clothes of a pilgrim and carried a simple elm walking staff.  In reality, the staff was magically enchanted to be more potent in combat, but Eron didn't want to risk advertising that fact.

@24314 = ~A sturdy hammer with a good deal of battlefield experience, Hellpick was used by the dwarven warrior Durlow Ironbar.  Durlow's hammer, like many dwarven weapons, was forged and blessed with power by priests of Moradin.  It earned its name in Durlow's service, where he used it to drive back drow wizards and their summoned abyssal allies.  Legends say that Durlow even defeated one of the dreaded Yochlol, the "Handmaidens of Lolth."  Durlow met his end when the drow employed treachery to defeat him.  Under magical disguise, drow assassins visited Durlow's fortified city as human ambassadors from Tethyr.  They then poisoned Durlow's food, which he ate in front of them.  Durlow eventually realized what was happening and managed to stumble to his room and grab Hellpick.  In the resulting battle, Durlow managed to kill four of the five assassins before he fell victim to the effects of the poison.  The fifth assassin is believed to have escaped.

When the nervous defenders tried to form a line of pikes, Kath and other heavily armored men would wade into the fray, hacking their weapons apart and breaking their formation.  Once the villagers had been sent into disarray, his men would fall in with cavalry and take what they wanted.  Kath eventually met his end when a rival warlord, Marhap the Blackbeard, destroyed Kath's army.

@24402 = ~She caught me wandering the Gloomfrost, an' when I saw her, it was like I'd been frozen -- an' I watched the last sight o' me life as her dagger plucked out me eyes. ~
@24403 = ~Why did she do that?~
@24404 = ~She feared I'd go tell the rest o' me Clan that I'd seen her in the Gloomfrost.  She didn't want me bringing any o' me brothers here -- or anyone else. ~

@24412 = ~~
@24413 = ~Ye'll do no such thing.  The matter's laid to rest between me an' her, an' it's none o' yer business.  Ye leave avenging to me when *I* feel it necessary, hear?~

@24426 = ~There comes a time in our life when we feel the forge's pull, an' we are guided to craft an item o' such quality, such strength, that it takes a part of ourselves.  ~

@24431 = ~~
@24432 = ~I never felt the call of iron or steel or mithril or silver -- all these things sleep beneath the earth, but in the Gloomfrost, I found the material I was to forge... ice.  ~
@24433 = ~Why would you forge ice into a weapon?~
@24434 = ~And that will give it power?  Ice seems too fragile. ~
@24435 = ~Ice - it is water, sky, stone, all in one.  It will be like forging the howling wind, the cold o' winter, an' the sky itself into a weapon.  ~
@24436 = ~Can ye feel the chill?  It's the ice o' the Gloomfrost, askin' to be worked, *needing* to be worked, slowly, carefully, with pick an' chisel, with a slow flame an' a craftsman's blade.~
@24437 = ~An' so that's why I came here - bringing me forge an' all me tools.  ~

@24455 = ~Is it better than ignoring the call until the time passes you by?~

@24495 = ~Tiernon, you're a member of the Hearthstone Clan, aren't you?~
@24496 = ~You made a mirror from ice... could you make a rose?~
@24497 = ~~
@24498 = ~I've been thinking.  When you gave me the mirror to the Seer's cave, you said I'd need to see the door's reflection in it to open it... but you're blind, which means it wouldn't work for you.~
@24499 = ~~
@24500 = ~Just checking on you, Tiernon.  Farewell.~
@24501 = ~~
@24502 = ~So the thief finally gathers the courage to speak to the blind ol' dwarf?  A brave one, ye are.~
@24503 = ~~
@24504 = ~Did ye think I didn't feel ye liftin' that little trinket from me pocket?  If it means so much to ye, then keep it.  Ye could have just asked for it, if ye'd wanted it so fierce. ~
@24505 = ~Uh... so I *can* keep the stone?~
@24506 = ~Then I trust you will allow me to keep the stone and do with it as I will, dwarf.  ~
@24507 = ~~
@24508 = ~I warned ye.  I warned *twice,* I did, an' ye *still* killed her.  Prepare yerself, ye filthy hound -- ye an' I have a reckoning, we do. ~
@24509 = ~Then you shall die as easily as the Seer did, dwarf.~
@24510 = ~She deserved to die for what she did to you, Tiernon.  We were only acting in your name. ~
@24511 = ~*I* act in *me* name, stranger.  No one else acts for me, there was no cause, an' ye had no right.  Now ye'll pay the price for what ye did.   ~
@24512 = ~~
@24513 = ~So be it, Tiernon.~
@24514 = ~Tiernon, wait!  Let me expl--~
@24515 = ~Well, aren't ye the sharpest axe on the rack?  Heh.~
@24516 = ~So how do you visit the Seer without seeing?~
@24517 = ~I know me own works, I do.  The door will open for me, mirror or no - the mirror was for ye, an' for her.~
@24518 = ~~
@24519 = ~I don't know.  She said I'd need to make a mirror for ye, an' I had to make it in yer presence.  I... hmm.~
@24520 = ~What is it?~
@24521 = ~Might be she wanted to trick ye into seein' yerself in it.  Maybe that was important to her, to ye... an' maybe whoever yer going to share that mirror with.  ~
@24522 = ~But I couldn't tell ye true, stranger.  The Seer be the one with the knowing, not I.~
@24523 = ~I'm sure you let on more than you know, Tiernon.  So out with it: What else can this mirror do?~
@24524 = ~I'm sure you let on more than you know, Tiernon.  So out with it: What else can the mirror do?~
@24525 = ~Heh.  Like a winter wolf on a tundra rabbit about this, are ye?  All right, let me show ye a trick with it -- hand me that serpent twine cord from the table.~
@24526 = ~All right.  Here you are.~
@24527 = ~Heh.  Like a winter wolf on a tundra rabbit about this, are ye?  Bring the mirror to me, an' maybe I'll show ye. ~
@24528 = ~~
@24529 = ~~
@24530 = ~All right, I will.  Farewell.~
@24531 = ~~
@24532 = ~Now loop it through the nicks there, tap it on the corners... an' ye'll find it a charm worth its weight in mithril.  Good enough for ye?~
@24533 = ~Quite.  Thanks, Tiernon. ~
@24534 = ~For now, Tiernon.  Don't think about pulling one over on me again, all right?~
@24535 = ~Aye... so anything *else* ye be wanting?~
@24536 = ~~
@24537 = ~~
@24538 = ~~
@24539 = ~~
@24540 = ~Tiernon, you're a member of the Hearthstone Clan, aren't you?  Word is you'd vanished from their settlement down south.~
@24541 = ~You can make a mirror of ice... could you make a rose?~
@24542 = ~~
@24543 = ~Nothing at the moment.  Farewell, Tiernon.~
@24544 = ~~
@24545 = ~Eh... now, Denthelm isn't a name I'm fond of, stranger.  Just Tiernon will do.  ~
@24546 = ~Denthelm's nothing to be ashamed of.  How were you to know the returning enchantment you inscribed on the throwing hammer worked unless you tr--~
@24547 = ~At the risk o' echoing meself, stranger, just *Tiernon* will do. ~
@24548 = ~But what happened to you?  Your weapons are practically legendary... but your own people don't even know where you vanished to.~
@24549 = ~~
@24550 = ~Aye, me business here is me own, stranger.  But ye've found me, ye have.  If ye want, ye can tell the fellows down in the Sunset Mountains I'm well an' good, making trouble as always.  Now who are ye an' what do ye want?~
@24551 = ~~
@24552 = ~~
@24553 = ~Aye, ye've found me, ye have.  If ye want, ye can tell the fellows down in the Sunset Mountains I'm well an' good, making trouble as always.  ~
@24554 = ~I'll let them know should I be traveling that way.  They'll be pleased to hear you're still alive.~
@24555 = ~I can't tell it by sight - let me hold it... heh.  I'd almost forgotten about this little piece.  The enchantment's nearly fallen asleep, though... let me see if I can wake it up...~
@24556 = ~All right.~
@24557 = ~There ye are... it's breathing steady as a winter's snow now.  Shouldn't be any more trouble. ~
@24558 = ~All right, then.  I'll put it to the test soon enough.~
@24559 = ~I'll put it to the test soon enough, then.~
@24560 = ~Wait.  Ye have something else o' mine, ye do.  That sword ye're carrying, the one that looks like it's been dredged from Dinneshere.  Where did ye come by it?~
@24561 = ~Aihonen's Blade?  I got it from a fisherman in Easthaven. ~
@24562 = ~Well, it wasn't meant for ye, it wasn't.  Must have been some fool that gave it to ye.  Its singing's off. ~
@24563 = ~"Its singing...?"  Did you make this?~
@24564 = ~Aye, long ago I may have -- for some poor fool that thought he'd take all o' Faerun on his shoulders.  Pah!  That damn thing's singing is making me ears bleed!  Hand it over!~
@24565 = ~Uh, all right.~
@24566 = ~Damnable metal... wail curses at *me,* will ye?!  I'll fix ye!  Not me fault yer master was a thrice-damned fool, not me fault he died... now, hold still, damn blade...~
@24567 = ~Tiernon, what are you d--?~
@24568 = ~Ye be quiet!  Give me a moment...~
@24569 = ~Last time I give a blade a woman's temperament - there, the lass is all better now, just needed a little comforting hand to smooth out the rough edges.  Keep her close, an' she'll watch out for ye. ~
@24570 = ~Thanks, Tiernon.  I'll wield this blade with honor. ~
@24571 = ~That's what I'm afraid of, stranger - that's what the last one who held her did.  Best ye be gone, now.~
@24572 = ~~
@24573 = ~~
@24574 = ~Farewell then, Tiernon.~
@24575 = ~Aye, perhaps I could... Why would ye want such a thing?~
@24576 = ~My reasons are my own, dwarf.  Can you make it or not?~
@24577 = ~I know of a man who spent his life in search of one... and it ruined him.  Perhaps it is not too late for him to find it, and his life, again. ~
@24578 = ~Hmm.  It'd be difficult... but a challenge, an' I'll not duck a challenge.  Hand me the small block of ice from the bench, an' let yer eyes guide me hands...~
@24579 = ~~
@24580 = ~Hmph.  Didn't know I had it in me.  Here ye are, then.  How does it look to ye?  ~
@24581 = ~It's beautiful, Tiernon.  It was as if it grew from the ice as you carved it.  ~
@24582 = ~It will suffice.  I'm sure the one I intend it for would accept anything vaguely shaped like a rose.~
@24583 = ~Maybe ye share yer tale o' how ye came to be here *first,* then I'll share me tales with ye.  Now who be ye?~
@24584 = ~~
@24585 = ~Wait.  That sword ye're carrying, the one that looks like it's been dredged from Dinneshere.  Where did ye come by it?~
@24586 = ~~
@24587 = ~Tiernon's Forge~

@24606 = ~"Where has my lord and master gone?"~

@24608 = ~[Resolved.]Death comes with swift wings.  My hiding place... is a place of hiding no longer.~ [SEER001]
@24609 = ~Silence, witch.  We have killed your beasts, now we have come for you. ~
@24610 = ~We know of what you did to Tiernon - we are here to see you harm no one else.~
@24611 = ~Hiding?  Why are you hiding here?  ~
@24612 = ~Your eyes... what happened to them?~
@24613 = ~Ah... the shaper of ice, the child of the elder races.  [Saddened]My fear whispered to me when he first came to these caves.  'Blind him,' it said.  My spirit was weak, so fear ruled my actions.~ [SEER002]
@24614 = ~[Confessing.]I took from him his eyes, for I feared he would tell others of my hiding place.  [Pause.]He has forgiven me... but the weakness of my spirit I cannot forgive. ~ [SEER003]
@24615 = ~He may have forgiven you, but you will receive no mercy from me.  Prepare yourself, witch. ~
@24616 = ~Very well.  Why are you hiding here?  ~
@24617 = ~Your eyes... did you tear those out as well?~
@24618 = ~[Was expecting this, not surprised, even in the face of violence.]So the crossing of our paths is upon us... I have seen this moment take place from a distance of many years, and I saw you would bring the spirits of violence with you. ~ [SEER004]
@24619 = ~You knew we were coming?~
@24620 = ~[Slightly amused by the question]Why am I hiding?  [Chiding.]Come... why does anyone hide?  ~ [SEER005]
@24621 = ~[Shifts gears dramatically, suddenly deadly serious.]*Death* is what I hide from.  My spirit fears for its life as do the spirits of all living things... so much that I must run from death, cheat it by hiding from it. ~ [SEER006]
@24622 = ~[Doesn't realize what the player's talking about.]My eyes?  [Gets it.]Ah, my eyes... they served me too well. ~ [SEER007]
@24623 = ~~
@24624 = ~An axe can be of the strongest steel, and so sharp it cleaves the man that wields it.  A fire can burn so fiercely it scars a child that seeks its warmth.  ~ [SEER008]
@24625 = ~And eyes can be blessed to see so far that a woman may see the end of her own life. ~ [SEER009]
@24626 = ~In seeing my own death... it turned my eyes to dust.  Yet still... I see.  Many things, past and present, here and elsewhere... your coming... and my death, both linked like chains.  ~ [SEER010]
@24627 = ~Your coming is why I buried myself here, for in visions, my death walks in your shadow.  It is for that that I fled my people, tried to hide myself from your eyes, and the reason I have long feared this meeting...~ [SEER011]
@24628 = ~[Tired, resolved to die.]Yet fear tires the spirit, and it has brought me little except more fear.  [Dismissive, doesn't care.]Kill me if you wish... or leave me here and *she* will kill me.  In the end, I die the same death.~ [SEER012]
@24629 = ~"She will find me?"  Who are you speaking of?~
@24630 = ~This "she" - is she the one you are hiding from?~
@24631 = ~[Almost 'tut-tutting' the player.]You have seen the creature that wears Wylfdene's body like a cloak.  She has chosen wisely, that one.~ [SEER013]
@24632 = ~Do you mean Jerrod?  Wylfdene told us he had merged with Jerrod's spirit.~
@24633 = ~Wylfdene is possessed?  By what?~
@24634 = ~No, no, Jerrod is long dead and gone from this world... this creature is of a different sort, a spirit of things that once were but can never be again.~ [SEER014]
@24635 = ~Who is this creature?~
@24636 = ~She is the spirit of one who died in the North long ago, and she carries the death of the North with her now.  She has taken Wylfdene's body, and with it, the heart of his people. ~ [SEER015]
@24637 = ~She is clever, and moves as ice moves, slowly and patiently.  She will prove a difficult foe, for she carries death with her... as do you all. ~ [SEER016]
@24638 = ~So how can we defeat this creature... this thing that's become Wylfdene?~
@24639 = ~If you know how we can kill her, witch, then *tell* us. ~
@24640 = ~All things have a weakness... and in this, the creature that is Wylfdene and I share a common one... Sight.~ [SEER017]
@24641 = ~[Turns promised answer into a question.]Do you know *why* I have hidden here, chosen *this* place? ~ [SEER018]
@24642 = ~The ice is a shield, more powerful than steel or iron.  Though it does not know this, the creature that is Wylfdene cannot approach it and remain Wylfdene. ~ [SEER019]
@24643 = ~~
@24644 = ~Speak plainly, witch.  I have little time to trade riddles with you.~
@24645 = ~Ice... is a curious thing.  One may see through it, yet see themselves *in* it.  Therein lies *power.*~ [SEER020]
@24646 = ~The creature that is Wylfdene is a proud thing, like all of her kind.  She cannot bear to see herself as anything other than she is, no matter what corpse she hides in.~ [SEER021]
@24647 = ~The mirror you held to enter here will force her to *see.*  In seeing, Wylfdene's body will melt from her like water...  No more Wylfdene, only the beast, the great wyrm of ice and snow. ~ [SEER022]
@24648 = ~Bring the ice mirror before her.  She will remember it, for it is of her, and a thing knows it own nature.~ [SEER023]
@24649 = ~But you can see what Wylfdene is... and what he isn't.  If you came with us, the barbarians would heed your word, and there would be no need for the mirror.~
@24650 = ~We have tracked you down through these filthy caves, and now you tell us to take a trinket before Wylfdene to end a war?  Better instead that you come with us and lend weight to our position.~
@24651 = ~In her shadow is my death.  I will not approach her.  The mirror is enough, and my words shall be heard only by you.~ [SEER024]
@24652 = ~If your Sight is true, then death will come for you whether you hide within these caves or not. ~
@24653 = ~~
@24654 = ~How can you be sure the mirror will expose her?~
@24655 = ~~
@24656 = ~Very well... if you will not come with us, then the mirror shall have to do.  I will take it to Wylfdene.~
@24657 = ~You speak truth... yet my path is mine.  Reason and fear are not brothers, and while I yet live, I shall not run to face my death *this* day or any other.~ [SEER025]
@24658 = ~So you will allow your enemy to choose the time of your death, rather than face it on your own terms?  Fear has truly claimed you.~

It still serves the same function as the original black ice mirror, but it feels much lighter now, and the reflections within the mirror seem both sharper and duller at the same time. 

The power of the Mirror of Black Ice lies in its ability to confound the sight of an attacker.  Merely wearing it provides a boon to the wearer's defenses, as attackers will discover the wearer suddenly isn't where they thought he was when they first attacked.  By concentrating on the mirror, however, the wearer may alter what others see when they look at him, distorting his image to make him harder to hit, or splitting his image into several reflections of himself, further confusing attackers.  The mirror contains only a limited number amount of energy to perform these greater feats, but when the Blur and Mirror Image powers are gone, the passive defenses will remain.

The cloak twists in torchlight, each strand of hair raveling and unraveling about the others so subtly that it appears as if a light breeze is rippling the cloak.

This cloak is woven from the hair of virgins sent to the Burial Isle to sleep with their dead barbarian lords.  It was the Seer's duty to comfort these women, to soothe their pain - in order to do so, she took a lock of hair from each and wove the strands into a cloak that would draw the spirits of fear from the virgins and steady their hearts.  The result was a cloak that hangs heavy with guilt and does little to shield the wearer from the cold of the North.  

When worn, the hairs weave around the wielder's frame, the long strands lacing together like threads on a loom.  The cloak will not willingly unravel itself from a wearer without being coerced by a Remove Curse spell.

The blade seems to draw its strength from Lac Dinneshere itself.  As long as the wielder is within a dragon's flight of the lake (a considerable distance by most race's standards), the blade is a fearsome weapon. 

The dwarven smith Tiernon has "soothed" this blade -- apparently, he was the one who forged it in the first place.  His skills have awoken some of the blade's original powers that had been drained when it was used to slay Icasaracht.

The woman, Prespera of Orlumbor, sold the dagger for a hefty sum and disappeared into obscurity.

Level: 4
Sphere: Combat
Range: Sight of Caster
Duration: 2 turns
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 1 allied creature
Saving Throw: None
This spell works only on player characters or allied creatures.  When cast, the target of this spell goes berserk, attacking the nearest creature until that creature is dead, then moving to the next target.  While under Blood Rage, the target is immune to charm, sleep, fear, hold, stunning, confusion, emotion, symbol spells, and related effects.  In addition, the target gains +2 to hit, +3 to damage, +2 strength, 10 extra hit points, and a bonus to his/her movement rate.  The spell has several disadvantages, however.  The hit points of the target are masked for the duration of the spell, and the target cannot benefit from any effect that heals hit points.  At the end of the spell's duration, the target becomes fatigued and their Strength drops to 3 for 2 turns.  Blood Rage cannot affect creatures of lawful alignment and cannot be cast by lawful characters.~

@24823 = ~A distinctive scent and the presence of several gray animal hairs leads you to believe there was a wolf in this building recently.~
@24824 = ~This area has seen much traffic recently.  Giant-sized footprints are everywhere, trampling the snow down into a tightly packed sheet.  In addition, human footprints are scattered about.  It appears that at first the populace of the town tried to flee, but were captured and driven towards the southeastern section of town.~
@24825 = ~A large number of tracks are visible in the snow.  The depth of the tracks combined with the angle of the steps indicates a dozen or more orcs are in the area.  Wolves may be nearby as well.  Amidst the smaller tracks are recent indentations that are much larger.  Whatever made the recent tracks would have to be the size of an ogre.  It also appears a cart was recently dragged through this small pass.~
@24826 = ~As might be expected, most of the tracks you find have been left by human adults and children.  However, several tracks appear to be humanoid in nature, possibly left by goblins or orcs.~
@24827 = ~Conjure Lesser Air Elemental~
@24828 = ~A large number of tracks are visible in the snow.  They seem to come from almost every direction, all converging on the distant community of Kuldahar.  The tracks are mostly goblins, with a few orcs and a set of ogre prints moving towards the tower at the center of the pass.  Recently, it appears the normally ordered war packs have disbanded and are wandering throughout the area.~
@24829 = ~Conjure Lesser Earth Elemental~
@24830 = ~Conjure Lesser Fire Elemental~
@24831 = ~Hundreds of tracks indicate the recent presence of a band of goblins in the area.  Some of the tracks are staggered in a way that leads you to believe a battle recently took place here.  It seems as though the goblins attacked a pack of giant insects.  Judging from the depth of the tracks, the goblins were likely weak and starving at the time of their attack.~
@24832 = ~The smell of this chamber leads you to believe that it served as a lair for giant beetles.~
@24833 = ~Judging by the smell of humanoid waste and hair, it is likely that an ogre recently took up residence in this tower.~
@24834 = ~Humans were recently killed in this house, and goblins and orcs are likely to have spent a good deal of time here.~
@24835 = ~This area seems to be supernaturally warmed.  There is nothing else that indicates why it should be in a state of summer when the rest of the pass is in the heart of winter.  The trails and tracks of human residents are evident everywhere.  Occasionally, you find a large green scale, possibly from an unusually large snake.~
@24836 = ~Even though this is obviously a house, there are no physical traces of habitation, nor are there tracks from a resident entering or exiting the building.~
@24837 = ~This valley is saturated with a supernatural aura.  Though it appears to be capable of supporting wildlife, virtually none is present.  Tracks indicate the presence of large, ape-like creatures.  Thick, coarse white hair leads you to believe that the beasts are native to the area and may be camouflaged.  Aside from your tracks, it seems as though one human traveler has been moving between Kuldahar and the Vale of Shadows on a regular basis.  Judging from the shape and size of the tracks, the individual is a female human or half-elf.  However, the depth of the tracks leads you to believe that the individual is traveling light, with little equipment or heavy clothing.  This is noteworthy in that anyone traveling in this area without protection from the cold would be dead within hours.~

@24843 = ~Your tracking skills reveal little about this location.  The only evidence of life in the area is a small portion of torn cloth near the entrance to the crypt.  It appears to be made of fine, white fabric.~
@24844 = ~There are many tracks here, both coming and going.  It appears as though several dozen creatures charged into the temple.  The deepest prints come from trolls, probably two dozen or more.  They led the pack in, and were followed by serpentine creatures and humans.  The serpentine creatures seem to have melted some of the snow in their passing, and were probably magically protected against the environment.  A large pack of humans or humanoids waited by the entrance and killed a number of giant humanoids who attempted to flee from the temple.  The attackers who waited at the entrance were all barefoot and extremely light.  Some tracks even appear to be skeletal, possibly a battalion of undead.  After a few hours of fighting, it seems most of the attackers withdrew from the temple and went back the way they came, into the mountains.~
@24845 = ~There are many tracks here, both coming and going.  It appears as though several dozen creatures charged into the temple.  Battles raged between troll and serpentine attackers against the human and verbeeg residents.  In many places, the presence of troll blood leads you to believe the defenders were able to down, but not kill, some of their troll attackers.  Given time to regenerate, the trolls and their allies eventually smashed their way through the defenses and moved deeper into the compound.~
@24846 = ~A significant battle took place here between human and verbeeg defenders and a large number of troll and serpentine attackers.  The battle did not last long.~
@24847 = ~There are many tracks here, both coming and going.  Recently, a large number of trolls, large serpents, humans, and possibly undead left the area and returned a day later.  You also see signs that lead you to believe that every few days, a small number of serpent creatures leave the area and move towards Kuldahar, later returning with humans.~
@24848 = ~Droppings on the floor lead indicate the presence of lizard men in the area.  The warm temperature of the caverns would be a suitable environment for them assuming they had enough food.  Traces of unusually large webs and consistent waste lead you to believe that there may be unnaturally large spiders in the southern portions of the caves.  Here and there, you also see bits of torn cloth and human hair.~
@24849 = ~The stench of this area is unmistakable.  Trolls must reside in this cavern complex.  In addition to the territorial claw marks on the walls and the all-too-abundant droppings, there are indications that giant insects might also live in the caves.  Acid burns on the walls and floor might reveal the presence of bombardier beetles.  You also believe a large number of humans recently moved through the area towards the southwest caves.~
@24850 = ~These caverns stink of decaying human flesh.  There is little evidence of any life in this complex.  However, it is obvious that a large number of corpses are nearby.~
@24851 = ~There is something odd about the nature of these worked caverns.  Though there are signs of human residence, there is an unmistakable reptilian scent in the air, and you note several large green scales on the ground.~
@24852 = ~Large numbers of green scales can be found on the walls and floor of this level.  In addition, there also seem to be some smaller scales of a sickly yellowish color.  The scales smell horrible.  Occasionally, you find extremely large, dark yellow iridescent scales, but you cannot place the creature.  The scales smell of sulfur.~
@24853 = ~Refuse left on the floor combined with the stench of body odor indicates the presence of goblinoids, probably orcs, in the caverns.  Given the nature of orcs, they likely have spread throughout the caves, the most powerful residing in the central chamber.  Trails of mud and water mark where objects were dragged across the cavern floor from the outside.~
@24854 = ~The tracks of many large orcs can be seen going into and out of this area.  Their stance, stride, and angle indicate that they must be orcs, but they are far larger than any orcs tracks you have ever seen.  Scattered here and there in the snow, you also find narrow tracks that are, in all likelihood, elven.  There are, perhaps, a dozen in total.~
@24855 = ~There are few tracks visible in this area, as the floor is mostly stone.  However, you do detect an overwhelming fungoid smell.  In addition, some of the mushroom stalks in this area appear to have been knocked aside by some giant humanoid creatures.~
@24856 = ~Telltale territorial markings on the walls indicate the presence of an umber hulk or a hook horror in the area.  The smell of offal tips you off to the likely presence of orogs to the south.~
@24857 = ~There are signs of human life in this area, but nothing else.~
@24858 = ~There seems to be a lot of traffic through this pass.  Serpentine creatures of great heat have melted the snow near the eastern cave entrance, and a variety of monstrous creatures have traveled through the area in every direction.~
@24859 = ~In the frost on the ground, you can discern that humans have recently hurried out of the area, while cold serpentine creatures still reside here.~
@24860 = ~Giant-sized humanoid tracks likely indicate the presence of frost giants.  In addition, wolf prints and coarse white hair lead you to believe small packs of winter wolves may be moving through the area.  Humanoid footprints of various sorts are all over the area.~
@24861 = ~The most common tracks in this area are the distinctive footprints of snow trolls and their cousins, ice trolls.  The distinctive coarse white hair and tracks of yeti can also be seen in some areas, as can the occasional serpentine tracks of some cold-resistant creature.~
@24862 = ~The smell of burned hair and flesh in this area leads you to believe humanoids or animals have been burned here recently.  In addition, the smell of sulfur is overpowering.  Whatever lives in this area must be resistant to the heat and fumes.~
@24863 = ~There are traces of subterranean humanoid life in this area, possibly dwarves or gnomes.  Huge scratches on many of the walls indicate umber hulks have been through this cavern complex before.  Other gigantic scratches on the stone indicate the presence of some other sort of giant creature, perhaps a huge insect of some sort.~
@24864 = ~This area is obviously home to many deep gnomes and at least a few transient members of other humanoid races.~
@24865 = ~There are few tracks in this area.  The only signs of life appear to have come from a single elven traveler, probably female, definitely heavily armed and armored.  She left a few days after she arrived and was carrying far more out than she brought in.~
@24866 = ~The smell of burned hair and flesh in this area leads you to believe that humanoids or animals have been burned here recently.  In addition, the smell of sulfur is overpowering.  Whatever lives in this area must be resistant to the heat and fumes.~
@24867 = ~Marks on the wall are the telltale territorial markings of a large number of umber hulks.  In addition, there is a strange smell of offal in the air.  It seems to be both human and animal.  It might come from some sort of hybrid monster.~
@24868 = ~Only the most tolerant of creatures could thrive in this oppressive environment.  Burned stone is everywhere, and cracked floors and bridges are common.  Whatever lives here is either very large, very resistant to heat, or both.~

Area of Effect: 30-foot radius
Saving Throw: None
When uttered, this spell turns the priest into a bridge between his god and the Prime Material Plane, allowing him to funnel magical energy to smite all creatures of good alignment in the area of effect.  The effects differ according to the target's level:

  Less than 4 - Death
  4 to 7          - Stunned for 1 turn
  8 to 11        - Slowed for 1 turn with a 75% chance of spell failure
  12 and up   - Deafened for 1 turn with 50% chance of spell failure

A sunfire is like a fireball - an explosive burst of flame, which delivers damage proportional to the level of the wizard who cast it - 1d6 points of damage for each level of experience of the spellcaster (up to a maximum of 15d6).  The wizard gestures with his hand and the entire area around him erupts in flames, striking all except for the caster.  Creatures failing their saving throws each suffer full damage from the blast.  Those who roll successful saving throws manage to dodge, fall flat, or roll aside, each receiving half damage.~

When my heart, like a smith's forge, was aglow
With the brightly burning flames of passion.
I was a bard, and, as was the fashion,

A wandering minstrel in for a meal.

When uttered, this spell turns the priest into a bridge between his god and the Prime Material Plane, allowing him to funnel magical energy to smite all creatures of evil alignment in the area of effect.  The effects differ according to the target's level:

  Less than 4 - Death
  4 to 7          - Stunned for 1 turn
  8 to 11        - Slowed for 1 turn with a 75% chance of spell failure
  12 and up   - Deafened for 1 turn with 50% chance of spell failure

There is no saving throw, and the effects last for the duration of the spell or until dispelled.  Note this spell may only be cast by good characters.~

Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None
Restoring life to the dead is one of the priest's most powerful spells. Resurrection can restore a character to life with full hit points; the deceased character must be in the party for this spell to work. Resurrection will not work on someone killed by a Death Spell, Finger of Death, Destruction, or Disintegrate. Unlike Raise Dead, Resurrection will work on elven characters. 

Note that when this spell is inscribed on a scroll, its power and range is diminished.  A scroll of Resurrection only works when invoked at the place where the target died; if the caster leaves the area and attempts to Resurrect his companion, the scroll will not work.

This spell can only be cast by good characters.~

@25819 = ~A beautiful weapon with a mocking name, Pig's Eye is an elven blade dedicated to the slaying of orcs.  Although its proper name is Gruumshacan, most people who know of the blade refer to it as Pig's Eye.  The name is an allusion to the fateful blow which Corellon Larethian, patron of the elven race, inflicted up Gruumsh, head of the orc pantheon.  The glass-encased orc eye that rests in the hilt makes it easy to recognize.

The blade was crafted in 239 DR by an elven enchanter and weaponsmith named Shenarr Caith.  After he had finished imbuing the weapon with its power, he gave it to his cousin, the ranger Velaic Caith, who put it to extensive use against orcs near Cormanthyr.  His son, Tredain, and his grandson, Galesic, also employed the blade for hundreds of years without misfortune.  Eventually, the Caith family decided to make the long migration to Evermeet.  As Gruumshacan was not the family's moonblade, the Caiths decided to trade the weapon for some of the funds necessary to transform their ancient uncle Shenarr into a baelnorn.  The last recorded remarks from Shenarr indicate that he was more than slightly amused at how the little blade had helped him defy death.

@25838 = ~We questioned Emmerich about the recent animal attacks.  He is convinced that the wolf that attacked him in the forest is also responsible for the murders in town.~
@25839 = ~Well met, strangers.  What can I do for you?~

@25841 = ~I see.  No small task... even for an obviously experienced band such as yourselves.  Nevertheless, your goal is a worthy one.  If there is anything I can do to aid you, just ask.~
@25842 = ~What do you want to know?~
@25843 = ~My name is Emmerich Hawk.  Who might you be?~
@25844 = ~I am what you might call the "caretaker" of these woods.  I keep an eye on the local hunters and loggers to make sure that they do not take more than the forest is willing to offer.~
@25845 = ~That may be.  However, what you do in these woods *is* my concern.  Tread lightly and take care to observe the laws of the forest, and we'll have no quarrel.~
@25846 = ~I'm a bowyer by trade.  I craft bows for trade with the few caravans that find their way up here to Lonelywood.  It's not much, but it's an honest living.  Besides, it allows me the freedom to pursue my true calling.~
@25847 = ~Guardian?  Perhaps once I may have been worthy of such a role... before I lost the favor of the Forest Father.  But now that he has taken his blessing from me, I am just another man that lives in the shadow of the forest.~
@25848 = ~The Forest Father is the eternal guardian of the forest.  He is the god of all wild and untamed nature throughout Faerun.  Priests and druids of the Realms call him Silvanus, though he is known by many names.~
@25849 = ~Ever since the three brothers arrived in town, trapping in the forest has been out of control.  Despite my best efforts, I have been unable to stop them.  Now, the Forest Father is punishing me for my failure.~
@25850 = ~Three days ago, while walking in the woods, I encountered a great white wolf.  Such beasts are very rare and are considered by some to be the sacred protectors of the forest. ~
@25851 = ~In an instant the wolf was upon me.  I searched desperately for a way to escape, but the beast was relentless in its fury.  Before I could react, it pounced on me, sinking its fangs deep into the exposed flesh just above my collar.~
@25852 = ~The weight of the massive wolf had me pinned to the ground, but I somehow managed to wriggle my left arm free enough to slip the dagger from my boot.  Just as the beast's powerful jaws began to tighten around my neck, I buried the dagger in its belly.~
@25853 = ~No, but the cut was deep enough to save my life.  The wounded beast ceased its attack and bounded away into the forest, leaving me barely conscious in a pool of my own blood. ~
@25854 = ~I should've died that day... I know that now.  The wolf was the manifestation of the Forest Father's vengeance.  The fact that I survived has only served to anger him further.  That is why he punishes me by denying his blessings.~
@25855 = ~Good.  And you can be sure that I'll hold you to your word.  I may have lost the favor of the Forest Father, but I still am capable looking after the people of this town.~
@25856 = ~For the past week or so, droves of barbarians have been spotted moving steadily southward towards the Ten-Towns.  It is much too late in the season for the tribes to be following the migration of the reindeer herd.  I fear their presence here could only mean one thing... war.~
@25857 = ~I've noticed that eastern edge of the forest has been unusually quiet these past few days, almost as if something has driven the animals out.  If there is a barbarian camp out there, it probably lies somewhere to the east of the forest.  Perhaps hidden upon the rocky shelves of Bremen's Run.~
@25858 = ~Sorry, but I'm not really one for gossip.  You see, I spend most of my time outside of town, looking after the forest.~
@25859 = ~Back again, eh?  What can I do for you this time?~
@25860 = ~Ah yes, Digby.  I wasn't surprised to hear an animal killed him.  He brought it on himself, you know.  I warned him and his brothers about excessive trapping in the forest.  Now it seems the forest has exacted its revenge.~
@25861 = ~Yes, I believe it's the same great white wolf.  Though I would hardly call it murder.  I'd say it was more like self-defense.  Digby and his brothers have taken enough wolf pelts to clothe an entire tribe of barbarians.~
@25862 = ~Ah yes, the animal attacks.  There's not much to tell really.  I warned all three of those thick-headed butchers about over trapping, but they wouldn't listen.  Now the forest has exacted its revenge.~
@25863 = ~I'm sure of it.  Though I would hardly call it murder.  I'd say it was more like self-defense.  Doogal and his brothers have taken enough wolf pelts to clothe an entire tribe of barbarians.~

Area of Effect: Target Creature 
Saving Throw: Special
When this spell is cast upon a target creature there will be two major effects.  The first is that the creatures magic resistance will be lowered by 10% + 1% per level of the caster.  The second is that it will cancel one spell protection of 6th level and lower on creature.  For example, if this spell was cast by a 15th level wizard the target creature would lose 25% magic resistance from his current total reducing it to 0 if less than that remains as well as canceling one 6th level or lower spell protection.  The list of spells that this includes is minor spell deflection, minor spell turning, spell deflection, minor globe of invulnerability, spell immunity and globe of invulnerability.  Magic resistance does not effect this spell, nor do any of the spell protections.  The resistance remains lowered for 1 round per level of the caster.~

This spell releases a burst of electrical energy at a target; unlike the Lightning Bolt spell, however, once the bolt strikes the initial target, the electricity then jumps to the next nearest creature (friend or foe), losing a small amount of energy with each additional strike until it is expended. The bolt initially inflicts 1-6 hit points of electrical damage/level of the caster, to a maximum of 12-72 points of damage. Each 'jump' the bolt makes reduces the damage by 1-6. Each creature that is hit is allowed a saving throw vs. spell for half damage.

The colors of the prismatic spray do the following: red (inflicts 20 hit points of damage, save vs. spell for half), orange (40 hit points of damage, save vs. spell for half), yellow (80 hit points of damage, save vs. spell for half), green (save vs. poison or die - survivors still take 20 hit points of poison damage), blue (save vs. petrification or turn to stone), or indigo (save vs. wand or go insane).

My skills as a bard for the night's event.
The King was kind, I'm pleased to report,
For he welcomed me into his court,
And treated me as an honored guest;
In return, I did promise him my best,

So lovely it would make his subjects swoon.

But as I performed, my eyes did meet
The gaze of an angel, lovely and sweet.

Pouring my soul out with each ringing note,
Until no more sound would come from my throat.

Where I would play music and she would talk
Of her betrothal to Lord Hugh the Red,
And how she wished she were free, instead,
To follow her heart and marry for love.
Oh, how I prayed, to the heavens above,
For the chance to make the Princess my own,
But Tymora's dice had already been thrown.
As I pined in vain, the nights quickly passed,
And the day of the wedding came at last;~
@26594 = ~But before the groom could offer his ring,
The princess bride declared to the King,
That she loved another and could not bear
To marry the Magistrate and forswear
Her one true love, at which point she did turn,
And spoke the words for which my heart did yearn:
I love thee, Murdaugh, and were it my say,
I would gladly marry you on this day.
Upon hearing her words, the groom went pale,
He turned to the King and started to rail,~
@26595 = ~On about law and tradition he went,
Begging his majesty not to consent,
For the Princess was of the noble line,
And could not be wed to some lowborn swine.
The King was torn, for his daughter was dear,
But the laws of the kingdom were quite clear;
So in silence he stood, shaking his head,
Until at last it was Lord Hugh the Red
Who proposed a solution - nay, a scheme,
Which, at that moment in time it did seem,~
@26596 = ~To be a fair and noble compromise,
For which I thought him to be very wise.
He pointed out that it was the King's right,
By law to bestow the title of Knight,
Upon any man who succeeds in a quest.
In addition, he did further suggest,
That because I was not of noble birth,
There was but one way to prove my worth:
Journey to the north, where the icewind blows,
There you must find the fabled Glacier Rose.~
@26597 = ~The King did heed his magistrate's advice,
And bade me quest for this rose made of ice,
And decreed to all that, should I succeed,
The hand of the Princess he would concede.
So, with hope in my heart, I sallied forth,
And began my journey through the frozen north;
For three years I did search, both high and low,
Across seas of ice and mountains of snow;
I visited all ten towns of Icewind Dale,
But alas, it seems, I was destined to fail.~
@26598 = ~After four long years, I gave up my search,
And traded my quest for this lonely perch,
For it was here upon this very stool,
That I realized I'd been played for a fool,
For as surely as the icewind blows,
There is no such thing as a Glacier Rose.~

"I have been studying the portal, trying to discern how the Master has changed it.  If I am successful, then at last we will be free of his tyranny.  The only clues that I have are in the form of one of his imbecilic riddles:

Heaven above, Earth and Sea below
Sun's flight, Day turns to Night
Seasons change all that we know
Stones numbered five bring the gate alive
To home the passage will flow

From what I can garner from this, five gems are needed to activate the device.  Each gem represents one of the five aspects of the gate: Heaven, Day, Earth, Sea, and Night.  Only by placing the correct gem, at the appropriate point, will the portal open.  

Now, this all seems rather straightforward, and that is exactly what worries me.  It is not the Master's way to be so forthcoming with information.  It is my belief that the gems, whatever they may be, must be changed somehow.  That would explain the line about the seasons.  I must think about this some more..."

@27102 = ~During our absence, humans had settled our lands and built the keep above.  The portal opened into their inner sanctum.  When my people stepped through the humans mistook us for invaders.  A terrible battle raged and we were driven back through the portal.~

No sacrifice will do

@27113 = ~One last question, Rikasha.  Where can the portal be found?~
@27114 = ~We asked Rikasha if he knew of a way out of the catacombs.  He told us of a portal located within a temple on a lake here.  The portal opens into the keep above, most likely the inner sanctum.  Unfortunately, the Luremaster has disabled the portal by removing key components and scattering them throughout the catacombs.  We need to discover what these components are.  Rikasha believes a shaman of his people may posses this knowledge but would be unwilling to share it.  The shamans reside in a room with standing stones.  Perhaps we can find a clue to this puzzle there.  ~

@27137 = ~Yeah, get on with it.  At my age, you learn not to waste time with chit-chat.~
@27138 = ~This?  It's my humble refuge from the sand and sun.  I've collected a few bits and pieces of treasure from the ruins over time.  Most of it's junk, but at least it occupies my time.~

@27140 = ~Sure, why not?  It's not like any of this junk has sentimental value.  Let me see what you have.~

@27143 = ~Please... please don't make me tell you.  H-he can hear us.  ::gulp::  He'll kill me if I tell you.  Kill me!~
@27144 = ~Look, I'm stuck here, just like you.  I'm sorry I wasn't entirely truthful when we met... I hope you don't die like all the others.  Oh!  I've said too much.  Please don't ask me any more!~
@27145 = ~As you poor the blood of Quallo's friend, the carrion crawler, into the pipe, the water turns crimson and a strange halo surrounds all of the pipes. From the filthy water, a sword rises to hover before you. As you grasp the hilt a scream echoes through the sewers.~
@27146 = ~Well, since you put it that way... I know who the Luremaster is.  I know all too well.  I have been his guest for decades now.  At least, I think it's been decades.  Let me back up a bit and explain things.~
@27147 = ~I used to be an adventurer, just like you.  Back then, I had a few less inches on my belly and a few more hairs on my foolish head.  My companions wanted to explore the Battle of the Bones, south of Evereska.  Well, I was interested in something else, a castle called Maluradek.~
@27148 = ~Yes, this very castle.  It was as ruined then as it is now.  The desert expanded, swallowing it up over a century ago.  I got in easy enough.  It was getting out that proved hard.~
@27149 = ~While I was searching for a way to get into the keep, the Luremaster appeared to me in all his ghostly glory.  He spoke in his usual cryptic manner, presenting me with his "heroes challenge."  ~
@27150 = ~What did I do?  I tucked tail and ran.  Without looking back, I scaled down the outer wall from the east parapets.  When I turned around to walk across the desert, I found myself back in the courtyard.  No matter how I tried to climb, jump, or dig my way out of this damned castle, I wound up getting nowhere.~
@27151 = ~After days of hard work without food or water, I was seeing things.  I must have passed out and started to dream.  That's when I saw the Luremaster again.  He asked me once again to take up his challenge.  I told him that I had just come searching for some treasure.  He had no pity for little old me.~
@27152 = ~He told me that only true heroes could leave the castle, and that, since I was obviously lacking in that department,  I would have to serve him if I wanted to stay alive.  He handed me a ring and told me it would transport me wherever I wanted for up to a day.  By dawn, I would always appear back in the courtyard.  In return, I was to find adventurers worthy of taking up his challenge.~

Apparently, we must prove to him that we are worthy of bearing the mantle of heroes, whatever that means.  The only clue he was willing to offer was this riddle:
 
North, east, south, and west,
In towers four the purgatives rest.
Feed them where the spirits nest,
Or forever here remain, our guest.
The sun rises, the earth warms,
Four men lie cold, yet no one mourns.
"Leave them be!" the mad lord warns,
and from my work their praise is shorn.

He told us to return once the task is complete, and we would be admitted inside the castle's keep.

It would seem that he has some tale he wants to share with us, but, rather than just tell us straight out, he wants us to discover it for ourselves.  Again, the only clue he offered was a riddle.

To understand this shameful tale,
Through princely guards you must prevail.
'Neath unused arms and unstruck mail,
Will you find the coffin's nail.
'Round and 'round the sun does fly,
And one man left below will die.
His crime?  To make the peasant's eye
Reflect his lord's ignoble lie.

@27209 = ~We encountered the Luremaster in the dungeons beneath the keep.  This time, his challenge was fairly straightforward: find a way out of the dungeon, or give up and die.  Perhaps his third riddle contains some clue that will help us discover a means of escape.

Your host was held unjustly while
The lord so full of wrath and guile
Demanded that this bard should style
A tale to make his people smile.
Suffer not your host's cruel doom,
Use your time to flee his room.
Shadowed dogs lurk in the gloom
And weave escape upon their loom.
If we chance to meet once more,
Your host will have a gift in store.
Defeat our shades in righteous war,
And we will trouble you no more.

@27333 = ~Yes, yes... they are.  I told myself it wasn't for the money.  And really, it wasn't.  I was greedy for fame, for glory.  I wanted to be *spectacular* in my humility.  What a fool I was then.  Too bad the currency for my payment was minted in my comrades.  Like Dabath.~

At first glance this cloak appears to be blinding white in color. However, it is in fact a composite of thousands of colors, which dance and play in any available light source. This barrage of scintillating colors tends to distract and partially blind anyone staring directly at the wearer.

The bow was then given to an assassin for hire, Teraven Docen, who was quite successful in bringing down many of the ice-maiden's children over a three-year period of bounty hunting. The assassin met his match, however, when attempting to ambush a traveling gnome who carried a wand of fireballs. Only the bow survived the repeated immolations.

@27366 = ~Chautog's Thinker~
@27367 = ~This rare helm owes its creation to an orcish warrior mage. 

Chautog's unusual story began when his village was destroyed in the crossfire from a battle between two rival wizard factions. One of the victors, the enchanter Shandellon, felt a twinge of guilt when he surveyed the collateral damage and as atonement took in the village's only survivor and raised the young orc as his son. 

Under Shandellon's tutelage, Chautog proved adept at magic despite his crude heritage. However, Chautog constantly found himself working harder than Shandellon's human apprentices and producing inferior results. As jealousy overtook him, Chautog locked himself in his room and toiled day and night on an enchanted item that would allow him to compete with his peers.

The fruit of his labor, though fairly unattractive, was an amazing helmet that would dramatically increase the wearer's intelligence. Chautog immediately donned his prize.  However, he quickly discovered that ignorance can be a boon to one whose existence is as pathetic as that of a jealous orc. Shandellon found the charred remains of his adopted son, still wearing the now coal-black helmet, next to a note bearing one simple sentence: "Some things are best left undone."

When worn, Chautog's Thinker confers an AC bonus of 1 and raises the wearer's intelligence by 2. However, the helm is unappealing to look at and quite heavy, being of orc design. Thus, charisma is lowered by 2 and a strength of 17 is required to comfortably wear the helm.

All manner of bandits, murderers, rapists, and other worthies were left dangling from it's knotty limbs; and all to the delight of the grave-digger Mordigan. For Mordigan, a secret practitioner of the necromantic arts, saw ample opportunity in which to ply his trade. Interring the remains of the evil men within close proximity of the tree, Mordigan called upon the dark powers of the negative material to perform a baleful act upon the black willow. It was given a sort of semi-sentience, and the ability to feed upon the remains of those who had so recently swung from its branches. Black roots descended into rotting flesh; and alarmingly enough, the tortured visages of the slain began to appear in the twisted knots of the black willow's bole before its burning. But, to the surprise of the villagers, the potently ensorcelled staff carved by the hands of the evil Mordigan did indeed prove to be their undoing. And thus did the hanged men of Dead Man's Tree have their revenge.

Apparently Prashnak was having a great deal of difficulty fending off a relentless scourge of trolls, who no doubt were interested in nothing more than his dug out, well stationed bower. Prashnak used storms of acid to keep the trolls at bay.  However the young mage was tiring of the constant attacks, and the trolls were becoming bolder.

After several months of studying the various effects of wilting magic, elemental summoning, and magical methods of frosting, Prashnak was finally ready to try his experiment. After summoning a water elemental, Prashnak evaporated choice bodily components and then froze the hapless creature. This lead to the creation of truly horrific sculptures of ice. The trolls, as simple as they are, took extreme offence to these totems and reportedly fled the area. The experiment a gleaming success, the exultant Prashnak continues his woeful studies to this day. What manner of thief took hold of the bracers is unknown, but they have been missing for several years.

During a battle in the northern wastes which became known as Hallowed Pass, Wychgar lost his three brothers to the orc army led by Kraag the Mighty. Wychgar was distraught and during the night he wandered the battlefield looking for their bodies to take away for proper burial. He stumbled across them and was visited by the brothers' spirits who were trapped between the land of the living and the land of the dead. Unable to help them leave he had their souls stored in the flail with the help of a shaman.

The three heads of the flail are his brother's skulls, which are attached to the shaft by silver chains. The three skull-heads grin maniacally at their new life. When the flail is used in combat the three heads bite the target, tearing and rendering flesh.

When Tamjuhk was sacked by efreet, githyanki, salamanders, and other malicious creatures, the efreeti Amir Talmed presented the weapon to the Grand Sultan of the city of Brass. Some time later, the Grand Sultan gave the weapon to Memnon, the efreeti who did battle with the djinni Calim over present-day Calimshan. Memnon used the weapon very little, deigning to give it to a powerful lieutenant. When Memnon and Calim fell to elven high magic, their servants fled or were driven back to their home planes.

Despite this, most theologians know very little about what happened to the unfortunate dying god whom the malefic trio consumed prior to their encounter with Jergal. What is known is that a small portion of the dead god's essence found its way to the Astral Plane, where it coalesced into one of the smallest islands of slain divinity. This small hunk of rock and odd ore was captured hundreds of years later by an enchanter named Merdros. Merdros' duergar servants created this blade for the wizard's most powerful warrior ally. Owners of the blade claimed that they could feel the dead god's final memories flowing through the weapon when they held it.

...only Watchknight Giles was not 
deterred by Aehirglass's sudden charge.  
Determined to shield Lord Maluradek's flight,
he refused to give ground to the storming
beast.  And so it was by keeping his wits 
about him, his keen eye saw another way the
dragon might be undone.  

With the sun high above him and mace
firmly in hand, he let the dragon's talons
rake at his tabard, exposing his shining 
breastplate to the sun.  Not a drop of blood
was shed, such was the skill he had timed
the swift dragon's speed.

He turned so that the breast of his 
gleaming armor caught the sun
and sent spears of the sun's rays
into the dragon's eyes.  Unprepared 
for the radiance, the lids of the beast
snapped closed, and his charge faltered,
the beast blinded!

And so with his Wits about him, Giles 
brought his great mace down upon
Aehirglass' skull, drawing the first blood of
the day...

...and the third of the four Watchknights fell, 
his spear planted in the ground against
Aehirglass' charge.  The dragon's wings 
were as shreds, its wounds were great, 
but the dragon knew the day was his.

It turned upon the last of the warriors, 
Erris, the fourth Watchknight.  There were
no other warriors to be seen, for Lord
Maluradek had still not taken the field.
Erris rushed in to strike but was snatched
up in the dragon's grip, and the creature's
head reared back to bite the Watchknight's
head from his body.

Yet Aehirglass had not counted on Erris'
strength.  Struggling against the dragon's
grip, the Watchknight cleaved through its 
neck with his mighty axe, the blade diving
into the gap in the scales of the dragon's throat
left by numerous spear and sword wounds.  

With a mighty cry to Helm, he made two blows
of one!  He reversed his swing to catch the neck
from the other side as the talons crushed at him, 
and there was a twin cracking like thunder, 
as the knight's body snapped in the dragon's grip... 

...and the dragon's head lolled from the neck 
like a felled tree, then collapsed to the ground, 
raising a cloud of sand across the Storm-Barrows.

A dragon's death matched with the deaths of four
Watchknights.  What can be said of such a valiant battle,
only Lord Maluradek knows.  He returned many hours
after the field had fallen silent, but not a tear was
shed for his fallen guards -- his eyes swam only with
gold and glory.

"The past is dust," was his eulogy to the corpses of
the Watchknights, " the road ahead is a golden one."

...the battle against Aehirglass grew long, 
and the sky turned bloody in the twilight as 
the Watchknights fought on.  Perhaps one 
extra blade would have saved their lives,
but Lord Maluradek was not to be seen.  

Watchknight Zierkki was quick to dash in, 
strike a blow with his spear, then retreat, 
forcing the dragon to turn and attack, 
exposing his flank for the other knights.  Even
near exhaustion, Zierkki fought on, fighting
against time itself.

Yet even against such a foe, he persevered.
No strength was wasted, not a drop of blood
shed without purpose, as the knight fought
on, from high sun to lingering twilight,
wearing out the dragon's strength, 
exhausting it while hording his own for 
one final strike against the beast...

...and it was then, Aehirglass rose from its desert berth, 
sand cresting around the azure wyrm like a storm, 
its wings beating like the sails of a mighty sea vessel,
scouring the dust bowl with thousands of teeth, 
each a grain of sand, swift and deadly. 

The fear that had gripped Lord Maluradek 
fell upon our hearts as well, with such weight
we wished to turn our horses and flee with our Lord
to the East, to seek safety within the castle walls.

But then came the crashing of the bravest of
the Watchknights, Geddian, his great sword 
ringing against his shield.  The sound gave us
pause and drowned out the roaring of the 
dragon and the wind.  The clashing of metal
beat a hymn to Helm, and courage filled our hearts.

"To me, my brothers," he cried.  "Steel your 
hearts and raise your weapons!  This beast 
shall not take us - our lives for our Lord!"

And thus, bolstered by Geddian's sword-drum, 
we held fast as the beast looped into the sky,
circling our band.  Fear rained from its body
yet fell harmlessly upon us like drops of water...

@27465 = ~A strange glyph glows upon the surface of this wooden door.  An unseen force repels all attempts to open it.~
@27466 = ~While the front and back of this heavy-bound book is of a tarnished bronze, its spine is nothing more than rotting cords of hemp strung through the covers and thick pages within.  Despite the tarnished surface and the drapery of cobwebs covering this manuscript, the writing within appears to have survived time's passage without fading. 

My audience with Lord Maluradek went poorly.  No sooner had I voiced my request than the Lord flew into a rage.  He threatened to lock me in the dungeon with the treacherous bard should I broach the subject of unsealing the crypts again.  I returned to the chapel shaken, and my eyes fell upon the symbol of Helm upon the tablet.  I fear I have failed my god by not protecting the Watchknights' reputations.  

My Lord's anger at my request has no foundation that I can see, and I find I am now suspicious about what transpired in his battle against the blue dragon at the Storm-Barrows.  The four Watchknights who died aiding their lord against such a beast should be accorded honors, not secreted away like skeletons of ill-omen.  A castle built upon such crumbling foundations cannot hold.  

I must make amends, do honor to the fallen Watchknights, but I fear to do so without angering his lordship.  He of the Unsleeping Eye, the Vigilant One, My Lord and God Helm is the champion of all guardians - yet which do I guard: the reputation of those brave Watchknights that gave their spirits in Helm's service, or the interests of my Lord?

And of the bard in the dungeons; what crime did he commit that angered... nay, terrified... my Lord so?  The Lord has gone so far as to issue a decree that the bard's name shall not be spoken or transcribed.  Even hinting at the minstrel's presence in the dungeon is now just cause for Maluradek to punish the transgressor, as one of the poor guards learned a fortnight ago.  It seems as if the Lord wishes to erase the bard from history itself.  What is it he fears so?

What tales might the Watchknights tell had they lived?

* * *

A plan of action has been discussed with the Adepts at the chapel, and our hearts are in agreement; we shall construct a hidden vault to honor the knights.  We shall conceal our efforts from Maluradek, and guard the vault with six keys fashioned from our ceremonial breastplates.  We melted each piece of armor down to forge the sextet of keys: copper, bronze, electrum, silver, gold, and platinum.  With these keys, we shall be able to enter the Watchknights' crypts and pay our respects while obeying Lord Maluradek's order that the crypt itself remained sealed. 

Yet my heart is not eased by this act; adhering to the word and not the spirit of my Lord only drags my own cowardice into the light.  Yet I can find no true path between Maluradek's wishes and defending the reputation of the Watchknights.  I feel as if my spirit is splayed upon a forked road, and I fear the branching shall tear me in two.

* * *

I heard the bard's song again today from the dungeons.  He sang, his voice strong and proud, through the hours of the high sun, through the twilight, and deep into the night before the Lord finally gathered his royal guards and unlocked the dungeons.  Not long after their descent below the castle, the singing was silenced, and many of the guards looked pale when they emerged from the dungeon.  Lord Maluradek held a bloody dagger in his hands, and his countenance was that of one near the brink of madness.  

I should have taken action when I saw the Lord and his guards make their way into the dungeons.  Now another corpse lies with the four Watchknights.  

* * *

A terror haunts the night.  Strange sounds, ghostly shapes, and echoes of the bard's song have been heard throughout the castle.  Whatever transpired in the dungeon between the bard and Maluradek has damned this castle and all its inhabitants.  The Lord has sealed himself within his chambers, and many of his servants and guards have either left the castle or have vanished.

I have nowhere to go, so I have stayed.  A great weight hangs on my heart, for Helm made his displeasure known to me.  As I stood before the offering bowl that holds the symbol of Helm and recited the evening prayers, the waters of the bowl turned dark and cloudy.  I placed my hand in the waters to retrieve the symbol, but my hands found nothing.  The symbol was gone.

I felt a spear enter my heart at this; the Vigilant One has seen my cowardice.  He has judged me.  I am condemned, unworthy to serve as High Watcher - unworthy to live.

I have made sure that the doors to the chapel are unlocked.  Whatever darkness now haunts the night, I await its judgment.

@27467 = ~This red-stained journal looks to have once been professionally bound, but the texture of its sodden pages suggest it was recently dropped in wine or blood and has yet to dry.  It is repellent to the touch, and the pages peel back from each other only reluctantly to reveal the scrawled words penned within.

We ride on the morrow for the Storm-Barrows -- I, the four Watchknights of Helm, and a bard to tell the tale of our journey.  A glorious adventure awaits - and my thoughts race at the treasure to be gained!  I am told the beast has laired in the Storm-Barrows for many summers.  No doubt that it has amassed quite a horde within its sinkhole!  It is fitting that the death of the beast shall fill my coffers and elevate me in the eyes of the commonfolk.  No more sullen glances, no more questioning the royal decrees, no more complaints of taxes, and policies, and border skirmishes... my deeds in the days ahead shall carve a new image of me in the eyes of my people, and the words of Lord Maluradek, Slayer of the Storm-Barrows Dragon, shall be as gold!

* * *

Word of my return spread quickly, and a hero's welcome awaited me as I rode through the gates of the castle.  With the head of the dragon raised high in my hands, the crowd of peasants fell to their knees in awe.  Without delay, I demanded a feast prepared to honor my victory -- and to the bard, the chronicler of my journey, I gave the task of writing the tale of my victory over the wyrm.  I told him to make haste with his words, for I wished the tale to be ready in time for the feast.  

There was some talk among the peasants and the Acolytes of Helm about what had happened to the dead Watchknights (at the bard's urging, we had carried their bodies back with us, though it slowed us for many leagues), and to prevent casting a pall over the coming celebration, I ordered the Watchknights' bodies be sealed within the crypts.  I spoke of their bravery against the dragon in touching words, and everyone appeared moved by their courage.  

I fear unless the Watchknights are interred soon, however, the many wounds upon their bodies will raise questions as to how I emerged from the battle unscathed.  It is best not to dwell upon it - as I told the bard, the past is dust.  The road ahead is a golden one!

* * *

The accursed bard has betrayed me!  His words have cut deeper than any blade.  How dare he spout such filth... such lies?!  His curdled words of the battle in the Storm-Barrows were treasonous, lifting up the efforts of the Watchknights above my own bravery, and cursing me for displaying cowardice in battle.  I!  His Lord!  

Oh, but his barbs were subtle.  Did he think I could not see his contempt?  That I could not hear his lies?  I ordered the guards to seize him before he could complete the tale, and tore the foul poem from his grasp.  I ordered him taken to the dungeon -- I shall see him rot in chains before he ever sees the sun's rays again!  

As he was being dragged from the hall, I ordered the guards to take his hands as punishment.  A... harsh lesson, yes, but one cannot permit treachery to abide within his castle, or else he puts all his dominion at risk.

It was only when I burned the venomous pages of the poem that night, I found some of the pages were missing!  This concerns me deeply --  if they were to fall into the hands of another... but, no, I must not think of it.  The tale is ended, the matter of the bard's fate closed.

* * *

The High Watcher of Helm came to see me at noonday, and feigning deference, he demanded I unseal the Watchknights' crypt so that "the dead may be honored." I cast him from the hall - since when are the actions of a hero questioned in his own throne room?!  What deed has that priestly fool ever done in the name of his unblinking god that merits even a footnote in history?  I will see him on the rack if he dares question my decrees again!

Yet... even though he has said he will do as I ask, I do not trust him; the Watchknights were of Helm, and the Watcher's sympathies lie with them, not I.  I shall watch him... I MUST watch him closely.  Should he move to betray me, I shall see him rotting with the bard below. 

* * *

One of the guards dared to speak the name of the bard today, and it was like a fresh wound upon my spirit.  I ordered the slack-tongued fool lashed to the gallows pole, his mouth choked with peppered rags, and forbid anyone from speaking or mentioning the bard from this day forward.  I will crush the bard's name to dust, bury the ashes, and see that he and his filthy words are forgotten by all!  A worthy fate for a venom-tongued creature such as he! 

I have taken the only key to the dungeons for myself.  I shall keep it close to me even as I sleep.  None shall see the bard, none shall feed him, and he shall eventually starve and die!  Choke on your own words, traitor, and justice shall be served!

* * *

He sings!  The damnable bard sings, and his song seeks me out even through the walls of my chambers!  I cannot sleep.  It is so loud that I fear none in the castle can help but hear it!  Torture me no more, villain, or I shall see you hanged!

* * *

I could bear no more of his singing - the bard is dead.  I severed his poisoned tongue, and left as the life rushed out of his body.  My guards... they... they are silent now, and they are afraid of me.  Good!  Let them fear!  Let them show respect - they know their lord is not of small courage now!

* * *

The bard lives... yet he does not!  His ghost comes to my chamber, singing, taunting me with the tale of my cowardice at the Storm-Barrows!  He calls me "hero," but the word sinks into my breast like an arrow.  My servants, my guards - they are gone... yet this beast remains to torture me!  Silence and peace - I long for both - silence, spirit, be silent, be SILENT!

* * *

I fear I can bear no more; I cannot trust my eyes or my ears.  Again today, the urge to put an end to my torment threatens to drown me.  What am I to do?  I have seen the ghostly hangman's noose swinging within the tower, with a silhouette that looks too much like my own.  I fear it is my future hanging from the rafters of the tower.  Do I embrace it?  No, I must not!  There must be some other way!  Yet there is no escape from the castle - all corridors bend back to the tower.  Is there no release from this hell but death?

* * *

The end nears.  The bard's spirit comes again tonight, and I cannot bear his voice again.  I go to the tower now, and I shall meet my future with eyes open.  I shall deny him the pleasure of killing me himself!  He shall be left alone with his words in this foul castle for all eternity!  We shall see if he can abide the silence of these halls - at least there shall be small comfort in that none shall hear the tale of Maluradek again. 

From obscurity I have come, to obscurity I shall go.

-  Lord Fallon Maluradek, Hero of the Storm-Barrows, Slayer of the Azure Wyrm Aehirglass

Level: 4
Range: 40 yards 
Duration: 5 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 
Upon casting this spell the wizard must throw several spider eggs (which is the material component) into the air while saying the final command word.  The result is that the eggs morph into fully grown spiders that will remain under the wizards telepathic control.  The type of spiders that appear depend upon the level of the wizard casting the spell.  
7th : giant spider
9th : phase spider
12th+ : sword spider
When the spell is cast there is a 20% chance that two spiders of the proper type will appear instead of just one.  These spider(s) will remain under the wizards control until effected by a dispel magic, slain, or the spell duration expires.~

Level: 6
Range: 40 yards 
Duration: 7 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 
There are two parts to this spell.  When cast the first part is to open up a small portal which will summon 1 or 2 carrion crawlers to point designated by the wizard.  The second part of the magic mutates the carrion crawlers into larger more vicious versions of themselves.  The result is that the wizard now has control over these creature(s) until they are effected by a dispel magic, slain, or the spell duration expires at which point if they are still alive, are returned to normal and teleported back to their original location.  When the spell is cast there is a 35% chance that two will be summoned instead of just one.~

Duration: 2 turns

Saving Throw: None
Using this spell, a wizard may attempt to reduce the magic resistance of a target creature.  The magic resistance of the victim works against the Lower Resistance spell itself, but at only half its normal value.  There is no saving throw.  If the victim does not resist the effects of this spell, his magic resistance is reduced by 30% plus 1% per experience level of the caster.~

You who carry out the work, I am your humble servant. When at last you need the final ingredient for the grand project, I shall be the one that brings it to you. Seek me out in the hills of Umar, and signal your identity with the purchase of  * BOOK TITLE HERE *. This will identify you, for I do not know your name, and nor should I. The need for security is paramount, so you must also utter my secret name, constructed from the name of your immediate master. There will be no mistake with this method. 

Our names are the same in their scale and their cut. 
The last of his begins in twofold just as the first of mine.
The next of mine is the first of his, though regressed a full four steps.
The last of my first is the last of his first, except the first one of these is the first of my last. 
The first of his last is mine plus one.
The next of my last is the next after last in the first. 
The last of my last are third and second though they come in first.

I am sorry for such games, but it is certain that only you shall know this. I await your arrival.

Level: 3
Range: Visual range of caster 
Duration: 2 rounds/level 
Casting Time: 3 
Area of Effect: special 
Saving Throw: Neg. 
This spell holds 1d4 undead creatures rigidly immobile and in place for five or more rounds. The hold person spell affects any bipedal human, demihuman, or humanoid of man size or smaller, including brownies, dryads, dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans, kobolds, lizard men, nixies, orcs, pixies, sprites, troglodytes, and others. Thus, a 10th-level fighter could be held, while an ogre could not. 
The effect is centered on the victim selected by the caster.  Every enemy within 5 feet of the target is also effected.  Those who succeed on their saving throws are totally unaffected by the spell. Undead creatures cannot be held.  Held creatures cannot move or speak, but they remain aware of events around them and can use abilities not requiring motion or speech. Being held does not prevent the worsening of the subject's condition due to wounds, disease, or poison.

(Necromancy) 
Level: 7
Range: line of sight of caster
Duration: 6 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special
The control undead spell allows the caster to take control of 1-4 undead creatures within the area of effect.  This creates a telepathic link between the casters and the undead allowing complete control.  If the undead have 3 Hit Dice or less then there is no saving throw allowed, however if they have 4 Hit Dice or more a save vs. spells is allowed to negate the effect.  The undead remain under control of the caster for the duration of the spell or until they are affected by a dispel magic.~

(Illusion/Phantasm)
Level: 7
Range: Sight of Caster 
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 30-foot radius
 Saving Throw: None
An improved version of invisibility with battlefield applications, Mass Invisibility can hide all creatures within its area of effect. Unlike improved invisibility, the invisibility is broken as soon as a target attacks.

@32429 = ~Invisibility 10' radius
(Illusion/Phantasm) 
Level: 3
Range: 0
Duration: Special 
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 10' radius
Saving Throw: None 
This spell causes all creatures within 10' of the caster to vanish from sight and be undetectable by normal vision or even infravision.  Of course, the invisible creature is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the creature detectable. Even allies cannot see the invisible creature or his gear, unless these allies can normally see invisible things or employ magic to do so.  Items dropped or put down by the invisible creature become visible, items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. The spell remains in effect until it is magically broken or dispelled, until the wizard or recipient cancels it, until the recipient attacks any creature, or until 24 hours have passed. Thus the invisible being can open doors, talk, eat, climb stairs, etc., but if he attacks, he immediately becomes visible, although the invisibility enables him to attack first.~

The Temple of Amaunator shines like a beacon of radiance in the hills of Umar.  Amaunator wards us from the shadows of evil.  Pilgrims come from areas far off to be blessed by the beauty of Amaunator.  Amaunator is endless and without equal.
Yet our god serves us well, in that he is constantly on vigil against shadows.  The Temple serves a further purpose towards this end.  Amuanator keeps the casters of shadows from walking the land.  Any and all who dare to taste of shadow magic should know that Amaunator and his most holy servants will seek them out and cast them into chains  with the Temple.
Lightstone, Dawn's Light, and Sun Rays are Holy Symbols, guides in any spiritual journey that a disciple of Amaunator may embark upon.

'Dark creatures roam the forests.  Several townspeople have been slain by some unknown predator.  Everyone seems to have their own opinion of what is doing the killing.  The strangest thing is that the bodies are disappearing in the morning.  This leaves me baffled, for most signs point to a pack of wolves that have been in the area for a long time.  Wolves don't steal bodies.
[date]
'Or perhaps I should say wolf-like creatures.  At night while I've been patrolling I've often caught shadowy glimpses of these 'wolves' running alongside me.  I've tried to attract their attention but they ignore me.  I find this most strange, as if the pack is being controlled by someone else.  Years ago I spoke with the pack leaders and they were cordial.  Now they either flee from me, or, and I fear to say this, they stalk me.
[date]
'It is near noon and still the wood outside my cabin seems full of shadows.  I've been hard pressed to hear birds and most of the larger animals have long fled.  I plan to find the wolf's den [this afternoon].  All signs point to them as being the culprits, but what wolves act like these?  They are wolves with the cunning of men.
'And there is something else, a whispering in my mind.  It is faint now, in the waking hours, but while I sleep I dream only of this voice and the face behind it.  Whether it is connected to the voices, I do not know.  I suspect by the time that the sun sets tonight I'll have answers to my questions. ~

@34090 = ~Lawrence Lilarcor was known throughout the land, not as a brave and noble hero, but as an idiot.  Bards first began to sing of Lilarcor when he was still a young boy.  The tales tell us that Lilarcor went North from his small town to battle a devious Treant (at the urging of his 'friends').  Lilarcor walked two days in the dead of winter, found the Treant and began an epic wrestling match.  Unfortunately (or perhaps not) for Lilarcor, the Treant was merely a normal tree and his friends had been jesting with him.  No one actually expected him to go fight the fictitious tree.  He never did realize his mistake, for after uprooting the tree and tearing it to pieces, he marched back home, declared himself a hero and became the laughing stock of the area.
Soon after that encounter, he became known as 'The One Who Shines...Not Too Much'.
 As a weapon, Lilarcor is useful, but many a warrior has passed this sword on to another.  Lilarcor's constant banter unnerves even the sternest of fighters.  Comments such as, "Ouch, that musta hurt", "Oh yeah!  Got 'im good!", and "Beware my bite for it might...it might...it might really hurt or something!" fight a relentless war on a warrior's psyche.
It is not known whether this enchanted weapon is Lilarcor, imprisoned by an evil mage, or some odd coincidence of fate.  However, the probability that two creatures as stupid as Lilarcor have ever existed in the Realms is highly unlikely.  If it is Lilarcor, he has never bemoaned his imprisonment.  Chances are he might not realize he is no longer a human anymore...

It claimed that in life, it was a paladin of Torm.  It tried to find out what was causing conflict between the elves of the Hand of the Seldarine and the dwarves of Dorn's Deep.

@7700124 = ~This scroll explains what he has to do.~
@7700125 = ~What were you saying about the Young Rage axe again?~
@7700126 = ~What do I need to do with Young Rage again?~
@7700127 = ~Take that note to your necromancer friend over on Burial Isle, so he can put the spirits in the axe to rest.~
@7700128 = ~I need you to banish the spirits of Young Rage.~
@7700129 = ~You need me to--what?~
@7700130 = ~A blind dwarven smith said we can banish the spirits plaguing this axe with the aid of a necromancer. He sent instructions.~
@7700131 = ~Let me see that.~
@7700132 = ~Yes, this seems straightforward enough. I'll need 300 gold for my services.~
@7700133 = ~Perhaps we'll do this later.~
@7700134 = ~It's a simple exorcism, for a cost of 300 gold.~
@7700135 = ~What's needed for the Young Rage axe again?~

 @770020 = ~Welcome back. I have your cloak ready, though I had forgotten how much I hate working with fur. I hope you enjoy it, for I will not be making another.~
 @770021 = ~From the reek, you can probably tell your yeti hide armor is ready. It will take many months for the smell to leave, and I will not be working with any more yeti pelts.~

 @770026 = ~How about yeti pelts?~
 @770027 = ~The pelts can be sewn together into a cloak. With a few cantrips, we can preserve some of the winter wolf's natural protections in the cloak.~
 @770028 = ~But it takes a lot of raw material and work. I'd need at least five pelts and 3500 gold.~
 @770029 = ~That sounds great. Let's do it.~
@7700210 = ~No, I don't think I'm interested.~
@7700211 = ~Yeti pelts are not the best of materials to work with, but Conlan and myself may be able to make some hide armor out of them.~
@7700212 = ~It's a bit tougher and stiffer than leather. I'll be able to lay some enchantments into the materials as they cure.~
@7700213 = ~It'll take a lot of material, though, and some pricey spell components. We'll probably need 10 pelts and, oh, 2500 gold.~
@7700214 = ~Excellent. I shall send these to the seamstress straightaway. Come back in a day or so and I'll have your cloak ready.~
@7700215 = ~Very well. I'll go and talk with Conlan about making some armor and enchanting it. Return in three days or so.~
@7700216 = ~Can I help you with anything else?~

 @770030 = ~I couldn't help notice that wooden box in your pack. May I take a closer look at it?~
 @770031 = ~Here you go.~
 @770032 = ~Why do you want to see it?~
 @770033 = ~It appears to be a collection of gnomish tools. There may be something there I could use to repair my airship.~
 @770034 = ~Oh yes, look at this! Where did you find this?~
 @770035 = ~It was in a yeti cave.~
 @770036 = ~That's none of your business.~
 @770037 = ~Does it really matter?~
 @770038 = ~I guess it doesn't really matter. I was merely curious.~
 @770039 = ~Yes, I think this could be very useful to me. And, I suspect, probably just deadweight for adventurers.~
@7700310 = ~For the toolbox, I'm willing to part with some of best potions. I think those may be more useful in your travels than some musty old toolbox.~
@7700311 = ~Sorry, Oswald, but I'd really rather have some gold.~
@7700312 = ~I'm interested... but what kind of potions?~
@7700313 = ~That sounds fair. You've got yourself a deal, Oswald.~
@7700314 = ~Ha! Think a bit of coin might be more useful! Fair enough, but I don't think I have as much coin to offer as potions. How does 150 gold sound?~
@7700315 = ~What potions, then, could you offer?~
@7700316 = ~Sorry Oswald, I'm not interested.~
@7700317 = ~Agreed.~
@7700318 = ~How about two potions of healing, a potion of invisibility, and a potion of heroism?~
@7700319 = ~Excellent, excellent. Now is there anything else I can help you with? Something from my stock, perhaps?~
@7700320 = ~I don't think you'll get a better offer. Ask around, and if you change your mind, come back and see me.~
@7700321 = ~Is there anything else I can help you with? Something from my stock, perhaps?~
@7700322 = ~Are you still interested in these tools?~
@7700323 = ~Yes I am. My offer remains two potions of healing, a potion of invisibility, and a potion of heroism.~
@7700324 = ~On second thought, I'm still not ready to sell these.~
@7700325 = ~Welcome back. I heard from Orrick that you bought the Girdle of Gond from him. I had my eye on that Girdle for some time but didn't act fast enough.~
@7700326 = ~I have a proposal that may be beneficial to both of us, if you'll hear me out.~
@7700327 = ~I wanted to examine the Girdle to see how it works--what enchantments have been used, how it's assembled, in the hopes that I may be able to make one myself.~
@7700328 = ~If you would be willing to part with it for a day... let's call it a loan... I would be most grateful.~
@7700329 = ~Sure Oswald, if it'll help your studies.~
@7700330 = ~I know too many gnomes. You're not going to take it apart, are you?~
@7700331 = ~I'll need some collateral.~
@7700332 = ~Sorry Oswald, I need this for my travels.~
@7700333 = ~Oh, err, no, of course not.~
@7700334 = ~Well, then go ahead.~
@7700335 = ~I'm afraid I don't have much I can spare at the moment. Would you take 50 gold?~
@7700336 = ~If that's all you have, just take the belt. I don't need the gold.~
@7700337 = ~Yeah, 50 gold is fine.~
@7700338 = ~Thank you! A day should be enough to sort out your little secrets...~
@7700339 = ~Did you still want to borrow the Girdle of Gond?~
@7700340 = ~Thank you for loaning me your Girdle of Gond. I've learned a great deal more than I had thought I would.~
@7700341 = ~So much, in fact, that I think I can make it work even better.~
@7700342 = ~With a few more enchantments, I think I can incorporate some of the tools from that dusty old toolbox you sold to me.~
@7700343 = ~The spell components are pretty costly, though. I'd need at least 1200 gold to get it done.~
@7700344 = ~The spell components are pretty costly, though. I'd need at least 1600 gold to get it done.~
@7700345 = ~That sounds great. Let's do it.~
@7700346 = ~That sounds interesting, but you'll have to give me some time to raise that much gold.~
@7700347 = ~No, I just want my Girdle back.~
@7700348 = ~Well, then here's your Girdle back. If you change your mind, I'd love to do some tinkering.~
@7700349 = ~I'll begin immediately. Come back in a day or so and I'll have it ready.~
@7700350 = ~Hello again friends. I'm pleased to have your completed belt.~
@7700351 = ~I've added more pouches and added some tools. You should be able to tackle better locks and traps now.~
@7700352 = ~You can still upgrade the Girdle of Gond, right?~

 @770040 = ~Can you help us with this Cynicism sword?~
 @770041 = ~Perhaps. Weapons are not my forte, but I can certainly examine it.~
 @770042 = ~Ah yes. I can see what you mean. It simply radiates cynicism and depression.~
 @770043 = ~I may be able to alleviate that somewhat, but I don't have the needed spell at hand.~
 @770044 = ~Do you have a scroll of Emotion: Hope? I can combine that with a permanence spell to, hopefully, relieve some of its depressing effects.~
 @770045 = ~Yes, here you are.~
 @770046 = ~No, but I'll return if I find one.~
 @770047 = ~Good, good. Excuse me for a moment, I don't want to do magic in front of my customers.~
 @770048 = ~How else may I be of service?~
 @770049 = ~There we are. I couldn't quite cheer it up entirely but it's much improved.~
@7700410 = ~I've brought some Emotion: Hope scrolls for you.~

@770050 = ~Can you do anything with these remorrhaz shells?~
@770051 = ~Sure. I know some craftsmen who can make helmets out of them. It'll cost 8000 gold.~
@770052 = ~I need some time to gather that much gold.~
@770053 = ~Thanks for the information.~
@770054 = ~Come back in three days and I'll have your helmet ready.~
@770055 = ~Anything else I can do for you?~
@770056 = ~Is my helmet ready yet, Dirty Llew?~
@770057 = ~Here you are.~
@770058 = ~Sure. I know some craftsmen who can make helmets out of them. It'll cost 7000 gold.~
@770059 = ~For you, my lovely, I know some craftsmen who can make helmets out of them. It'll cost 5000 gold.~

@770060 = ~Can you tell me more about Bren Muller?~
@770061 = ~Ah. You ask not for Bren Muller, but for his crossbow, yes?~
@770062 = ~Bren Muller was more than a scholar, but a mage of some repute.~
@770063 = ~Unusually for a mage, he relied on a crossbow. Even more unusual was his incredible accuracy.~
@770064 = ~It is believed that he took grat pains to build and enchant his crossbow to maximize his accuracy.~
@770065 = ~Not only is it unusually accurate, but it can be boosted even further for a short period of time.~

@770070 = ~What do you make of this mithril hammer?~
@770071 = ~Interesting. I believe this is the symbol of one of the local dwarven clans--the Battlehammers.~
@770072 = ~The dwarves are known for their craftmanship, and I can see it. This feels like it's magical as well.~
@770073 = ~What does it do?~
@770074 = ~Interesting. Thanks Conlan.~
@770075 = ~Well, the dwarves are also very secretive of their methods so I can't say for sure, but it doesn't feel very... focused.~
@770076 = ~What do you mean?~
@770077 = ~It's hard to explain. Usually you can feel a... purpose to most magic. This seems... vague and fuzzy, like it wasn't enchanted with a clear goal.~
@770078 = ~If I could get a better feel for the type of magic used by these dwarves... well, just keep your eyes open for more Battlehammer items and maybe I can figure it out.~
@770079 = ~This Stoutward shield is from Clan Battlehammer.~
@7700710 = ~Here, let me see that.~
@7700711 = ~Yes, I can feel the similarity. Even more interesting, these seem to have an affinity for each other.~
@7700712 = ~It's possible we may be able to combine them.~
@7700713 = ~What would that involve?~
@7700714 = ~I'd rather not risk it.~
@7700715 = ~It's fairly tricky, and mithril doesn't always react well after its been imbued.~
@7700716 = ~I think I could probably add this as a standard for the shield. I'm not sure what, exactly, that would do for Stoutward's abilities.~
@7700717 = ~And it's a solid day of work. But since you've rescued Smeesh I'll waive most of the costs. How about 1000 gold?~
@7700718 = ~If you change your mind, let me know.~
@7700719 = ~What else can I do for you?~
@7700720 = ~Sure, that sounds like a bargain.~
@7700721 = ~And it's a solid day of work. How about 4500 gold?~
@7700722 = ~I don't have enough gold at the moment. Perhaps later.~
@7700723 = ~When you've got the gold, I've got the time.~
@7700724 = ~Come back in a day and your new shield will be ready.~
@7700725 = ~What were you saying about this mithril hammer again?~
@7700726 = ~Welcome back. I have successfully merged the symbol with Stoutward.~
@7700727 = ~Combining them was fairly straightforward, like they were meant for each other.~
@7700728 = ~Here's Stoutward back. I think you'll find it's a lot stronger now.~
@7700729 = ~Can I commission armor from these white dragon scales?~
@7700730 = ~Dragon! I never thought I'd see something like this.~
@7700731 = ~I I don't have much experience with exotic materials such as these, but I should be able to make some armor from them.~
@7700732 = ~I'll take it slow--let's say three days to finish--and make sure it's right, as dragon scales don't grow on trees.~
@7700733 = ~My commission is 5000 gold.~
@7700734 = ~For dragon scale armor? Yes, let's do it.~
@7700735 = ~Alright. Come back in three days and I should have it ready for you.~
@7700736 = ~Sorry Conlan, I'm not interested.~
@7700737 = ~What was involved in making White Dragon Scale again?~
@7700738 = ~Welcome back. I was just putting a last coat of polish the white dragon armor.~
@7700739 = ~Well, of course, it's your armor now.~
@7700740 = ~Travel well, friend. I doubt you'll find better protection than this.~

It is considered too cumbersome for use in advanced human cultures, but is common among more barbaric humanoids.  It offers better protection than normal leather, but can be hard to maintain, often resulting in an offensive odor or shoddy appearance that prevents effective use.

This particular set of armor was cured by Conlan and enchanted by Orrick. Orrick was not able to quite get rid of its inherited weakness against fire, though it offers some natural protection against cold.

Legedain was growing old and becoming tired of his frail body.  To remedy the situation, he cast Magic Jar and forced Ilfain's spirit into a host gem.  Legedain then transferred his soul to the young elf's body and left the gem on a shelf nearby.  One hundred years later, Legedain decided to do something with it.  He created a sword for his arrogant bodyguard, Gundak, and transferred Ilfain's spirit from the host gem into the sword.  Ilfain, always highly critical in life, started telepathically criticizing Gundak in combat.  Gundak became annoyed with the sword after two weeks and he threw it into the street.  A series of warriors picked it up and discarded it after short periods of ownership. The constant criticism from the sword also makes it difficult to hit its target. Over time, the weapon has simply come to be known by its current name.

Kieran Nye has applied a permanent Hope spell to the sword. While the sword is still very gloomy, it no longer criticizes its wielder and its thieving abilities can be used more often.

It is said by some that after he found the sword, quite by accident, that he was blessed with exceptional creativity and powerful sensitivity to the world around him.  He traveled for forty years and is known for some of the most unique, haunting melodies in Faerun.  It is believed that Daen eventually became too melancholy at the sights of misery and oppression that he encountered in his travels, and that the fae smiths of the Moonshae Isles welcomed him into the breast of Myrloch.

By singing the ballad of Daen Winterbrush and speaking with his spirit, more abilities of the blade have been awakened.

@770081020 = ~This axe was crafted for a powerful young barbarian warrior named Hegelfden.  He was born into the Tribe of the Elk and the shamans prophesized that he would be a powerful warrior.  Hegelfden grew up believing that he was special, important, and somehow better than those around him.  By the age of seventeen, Hegelfden was an accomplished warrior.  Huge, fast, and cunning, he was more than a match for his kinsmen.  On a journey into the Spine of the World, Hegelfden captured two dwarves that he came across in a cave.  He refused to let the two workers go until they created a magnificent axe for him.  The two dwarves reluctantly agreed, creating a stout battle axe with a keen blade and a thick handle.  When the dwarves asked to be released, Hegelfden denied their request.  He wanted to keep them as servants.  The dwarves then laid a curse upon Hegelfden.  They told him that the fruit of his abuse would be the end of him.  Hegelfden laughed at the dwarves' claim and continued on with his life.  The next day, in a battle with a rival tribe, Hegelfden went berserk with blood lust, slaying every creature he came across.  His kin, convinced that he had gone mad, cut him down where he stood.  The axe was left on the field when the warriors brought Hegelfden's body back to the camp.  When they arrived, the dwarves were nowhere to be found.

With Tiernon's guidance, the angry dwarven souls in the axe have been laid to rest.

Plane-traveling wizards who have investigated life on "Eibrancha" report that it is dull, commonplace, and ordinary in the extreme, a place where heroes are rare and the populace is, by and large, incredibly average.  This might explain the virtually non-existent body of recorded information about the place.  The only thing known about the weapon's owner is that he was an educated man. The purple wood that the crossbow is constructed from is believed to be from a unique type of tree in Eibrancha.

Legedain was growing old and becoming tired of his frail body.  To remedy the situation, he cast Magic Jar and forced Ilfain's spirit into a host gem.  Legedain then transferred his soul to the young elf's body and left the gem on a shelf nearby.  One hundred years later, Legedain decided to do something with it.  He created a sword for his arrogant bodyguard, Gundak, and transferred Ilfain's spirit from the host gem into the sword.  Ilfain, always highly critical in life, started telepathically criticizing Gundak in combat.  Gundak became annoyed with the sword after two weeks and he threw it into the street.  A series of warriors picked it up and discarded it after short periods of ownership. The constant criticism from the sword also makes it difficult to hit its target. Over time, the weapon has simply come to be known by its current name.

When her family urged her to find a husband, she issued a challenge to the men of the land: Whoever could make her yield in single combat could have her hand. The suitors gathered from all across Kara-Tur to test their skill, and although she fought with no weapons but her open hands, she bested every single one of them. Disappointed, all suitors left but one—a young man with kind eyes and a pair of gilded bracers, which he presented to her as a gift. "No one can hope to tame your passions," he said, "and those who would try will never understand your heart. May these trinkets serve as a reminder that your temper is your own and not to be controlled." Lin Mei did not marry that man, but she left home with him that day to seek adventure, and together they spent the rest of their lives in closer partnership than any husband and wife. Eventually the pair retired, and Lin Mei quietly disappeared from the annals of history. All that remains of her story are the bracers she wore, still burning with the fire of her untamed passion.

Sarutobi carried the day, and the merchant locked the bracers away in his safe. When Sarutobi disappeared one day through a planar door, the merchant took the opportunity to give the bracers to Sarutobi's son, as small compensation for the loss of his father. The boy took the bracers and devoted his life to searching for his father. He never found him.

The truth is both less interesting and more: the source of Geraq's power was a strange stone, which the goblin carried everywhere he went. Where he found the stone is a mystery, as well as where it went after Geraq's mysterious disappearance, but holding it in one's hand, one can hear the whispers of Geraq's expertise sounding across the centuries. Of course, the whispers are all spoken in the language of goblins, making them more or less useless to the humanoid races; even so, the stone bestows greater knowledge on any who possess it.
